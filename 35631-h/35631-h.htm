<h2>FOREWORDS</h2>

<p>This <i>Letter</i> by Prof. Spalding has always seemd to me one of the ablest
(if not the ablest) and most stimulating pieces of Shakspere criticism I
ever read. And even if you differ from the writer's conclusion as to
Shakspere's part, or even hold that Shakspere took no part at all, in
the Play, you still get almost as much good from the essay as if you
accept its conclusions as to the authorship of <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>.
It is for its general, more than for its special, discussions, that I
value this <i>Letter</i>. The close reasoning, the spirited language, the
perception and distinction of the special qualities of Shakspere's work,
the investigation into the nature of dramatic art, the grasp of subject,
and the mixt logic and enthusiasm of the whole <i>Letter</i>, are worthy of a
true critic of our great poet, and of the distinguisht Professor of
Logic, Rhetoric, and Metaphysics, who wrote this treatise, that at once
delights and informs every one who reads it. No wonder it carrid away
and convinct even the calm judicial mind of Hallam.</p>

<p>Indeed, while reading the <i>Letter</i>, one can hardly resist the power of
Prof. Spalding's argument, backt as it is by his well-chosen passages
from the Play. But when one turns to the play itself, when one reads it
aloud with a party of friends, then come doubt and hesitation. One
begins to ask, 'Is this indeed Shakspere, Shakspere at the end of his
glorious career, Shakspere who has just given us Perdita, Hermione and
Autolycus'?</p>

<p>Full of the heavenly beauty of Perdita's flowers, one reads over <i>The
Two Noble Kinsmen</i> flower-song, and asks, pretty as the fancy of a few
of the epithets is, whether all that Shakspere, with the spring-flowers
of Stratford about him, and the love of nature deeper than ever in his
soul&mdash;whether all he has to say of the daisy&mdash;Chaucer's 'Quene of
flourës alle'&mdash;is, that it is "smelless but most quaint"; and of
marigolds, that they blow on death-beds<a name="FNanchor_v:1_1" id="FNanchor_v:1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_v:1_1" class="fnanchor">[v:1]</a>, when one recollects his
twenty-years' earlier <!-- Page vi --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"></a>[<a href="./images/vi.png">vi</a>]</span>use of them in <i>Lucrece</i> (<span class="allcapsc">A.D.</span> 1594):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Without the bed her other fair hand was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the green coverlet; whose perfect white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Show'd like an April <i>daisy</i> on the grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pearly sweat, resembling dew of night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her eyes, like <i>marigolds</i>, had sheath'd their light,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And canopied in darkness sweetly lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Till they might open to adorn the day.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Full of the ineffable charm and consistency of Miranda and Perdita, one
asks of Emilia&mdash;Chaucer's daring huntress, virgin free, seeking no
marriage-bed&mdash;whether Shakspere, at the crisis of her life, degraded her
to a silly lady's-maid or shop-girl, not knowing her own mind, up and
down like a bucket in a well, balancing her lovers' qualities against
one another, saying she'd worn the losing Palamon's portrait on her
right side, not the heart one, her left, &amp;c.; and then (oh dear!) that
Palamon might wound Arcite and <i>spoil his figure</i>! What a pity it would
be!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Arcite may win me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet may Palamon wound Arcite to<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spoyling of his figure. O what pitty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough for such a chance!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem">V. iii. 68-71, p. 81, ed. Littledale.</p>

<p>I say, is it possible to believe that Shakspere turnd a noble lady, a
frank gallant nature, whose character he had rightly seizd at first,
into a goose of this kind, whom one would like to shake, or box her ears
well? The thing is surely impossible. Again, is it likely&mdash;and again, I
say, at the end of his career, with all his experience behind him, that
Shakspere would make his hero Palamon publicly urge on Venus in his
prayer to her, that she was bound to protect him because he'd believd a
wanton young wife's word that her old incapable husband was the father
of her <!-- Page vii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii"></a>[<a href="./images/vii.png">vii</a>]</span>child? Is this the kind of thing that the Shakspere of Imogen,
of Desdemona, of Queen Catherine, would put forward as the crown of his
life and work? Again I say, it can hardly be.</p>

<p>Further, when at one's reading-party one turns to the cleverest and most
poetic-natured girl-friend, and says, 'This is assignd to Shakspere. Do
you feel it's his?' She answers, 'Not a bit. And no one else does
either. Look how people's eyes are all off their books. They don't care
for it: you never see that when we're reading one of Shakspere's genuine
plays.' Then when you note Prof. Spalding's own admission in his
<i>Letter</i>, p. 81, that in Shakspere's special excellence,
characterization, the play is&mdash;as of course it is&mdash;weak, and that it is
to be compard on the one hand with his weaker early work, and on the
other with his latest <i>Henry VIII</i>, more than half of which Fletcher
wrote, you are not surpris'd to find that in 1840,<a name="FNanchor_vii:1_3" id="FNanchor_vii:1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_vii:1_3" class="fnanchor">[vii:1]</a> seven years
after the date of his <i>Letter</i>, Professor Spalding had concluded, that
on Shakspere's having taken part in <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, his
"opinion is not now so decided as it once was," and that by 1847 he was
still less decided, and declared the question "really insoluble." Here
is the full passage from his article on Dyce's "Beaumont and Fletcher,"
in the <i>Edinb. Review</i>, July 1847, p. 57:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In measuring the height of Beaumont and Fletcher, we cannot
take a better scale than to put them alongside Shakespeare,
and compare them with him. In this manner, an imaginary
supposition may assist us in determining the nature of their
excellence, and almost enable us to fix its degree. Suppose
there were to be discovered, in the library of the Earl of
Ellesmere, or in that of the Duke of Devonshire, two dramas
not known before, and of doubtful authorship, the one being
'Hamlet,' and the other 'The Winter's Tale.' We should be at
no loss, we think, to assign the former to Shakespeare: the
judgment would be warranted alike by the consideration of the
whole, and by a scrutiny of particular parts. But with regard
to the other play, hesitation would not be at all
unreasonable. Beaumont and Fletcher (as an eminent living
critic has remarked to us) might be believed to have written
all its serious parts, more especially the scenes of the
jealousy of Leontes, and those beautiful ones which describe
the rustic festival<a name="FNanchor_vii:2_4" id="FNanchor_vii:2_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_vii:2_4" class="fnanchor">[vii:2]</a>. Strange to say, a case of this
kind has actually arisen. And the uncertainty which still
hangs over it, agrees entirely with the hesitation which we
have ventured to imagine as arising in the case we have
supposed.</p>

<p>"In 1634, eighteen years after Beaumont's death, and nine
after Fletcher's, there was printed, for the first time, the
play called 'The Two Noble Kinsmen.' The bookseller in his
title-page declared it to have <!-- Page viii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii"></a>[<a href="./images/viii.png">viii</a>]</span>been 'written by the
memorable worthies of their time, Mr John Fletcher and Mr
William Shakespeare, gentlemen.' On the faith of this
assertion, and on the evidence afforded by the character of
the work, it has been assumed universally, that Fletcher had
a share in the authorship. Shakespeare's part in it has been
denied; though there is, perhaps, a preponderance of
authority for the affirmative. Those who maintain the joint
authorship, commonly suppose the two poets to have written
together: but Mr Dyce questions this, and gives us an
ingenious theory of his own, which assumes Fletcher to have
taken up and altered the work long after Shakespeare's labour
on it had been closed.</p>

<p>"<i>The question of Shakespeare's share in this play is really
insoluble.</i> On the one hand, there are reasons making it very
difficult to believe that he can have had any concern in it;
<i>particularly the heavy and undramatic construction of the
piece, and the want of individuality in the characters</i>.
Besides, we encounter in it direct and palpable imitations of
Shakespeare himself; among which the most prominent is the
wretchedly drawn character of the jailor's daughter. On the
other hand, there are, in many passages, resemblances of
expression (in the very particulars in which our two poets
are most unlike Shakespeare) so close, that we must either
admit Shakespeare's authorship of these parts, or suppose
Fletcher or some one else to have imitated him designedly,
and with very marvellous success. Among these passages, too,
there are not a few which display a brilliancy of
imagination, and a grasp of thought, much beyond Fletcher's
ordinary pitch. Readers who lean to Mr Dyce's theory, will
desire to learn his grounds for believing that Fletcher's
labour in the play was performed in the latter part of his
life. It appears to us that the piece bears a close likeness
to those more elevated works which are known to have been
among the earliest of our series: and if it were not an
unbrotherly act to throw a new bone of contention among the
critics, we would hint that there is no evidence entitling us
peremptorily to assert that Fletcher was concerned in the
work to the exclusion of Beaumont.</p>

<p>"Be the authorship whose it may, 'The Two Noble Kinsmen' is
undoubtedly one of the finest dramas in the volumes before
us. It contains passages which, in dramatic vigour and
passion, yield hardly to anything&mdash;perhaps to nothing&mdash;in the
whole collection; while for gorgeousness of imagery, for
delicacy of poetic feeling, and for grace, animation, and
strength of language, we doubt whether there exists, under
the names of our authors, any drama that comes near to
it.<a name="FNanchor_viii:1_5" id="FNanchor_viii:1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_viii:1_5" class="fnanchor">[viii:1]</a> Never has any theme enjoyed the honours which
have befallen the semi-classical legend of Palamon and
Arcite. Chosen as the foundation of chivalrous narrative by
Boccaccio, Chaucer, and Dryden, it has furnished one of the
<!-- Page ix --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix"></a>[<a href="./images/ix.png">ix</a>]</span>fairest of the flowers that compose the dramatic crown of
Fletcher, while from that flower, perhaps, leaves might be
plucked to decorate another brow which needs them not.</p>

<p>"If the admirers of Fletcher could vindicate for him the
fifth act of this play, they would entitle him to a still
higher claim upon our gratitude, as the author of a series of
scenes, as picturesquely conceived, and as poetically set
forth, as any that our literature can boast. Dramatically
considered, these scenes are very faulty: perhaps there are
but two of them that have high dramatic merits&mdash;the
interrupted execution of Palamon, and the preceding scene in
which Emilia, left in the forest, hears the tumult of the
battle, and receives successive reports of its changes and
issue. But as a gallery of poetical pictures, as a cluster of
images suggestive alike to the imagination and the feelings,
as a cabinet of jewels whose lustre dazzles the eye and
blinds it to the unskilful setting,&mdash;in this light there are
few pieces comparable to the magnificent scene before the
temples, where the lady and her lovers pray to the gods: and
the pathetically solemn close of the drama, admirable in
itself, loses only when we compare it with the death of
Arcite in Chaucer's masterpiece, 'the Iliad of the middle
ages.'"</p></div>

<p>All this does but show how well-founded was the judgment which that
sound scholar and able Shaksperian critic, Prof. Ingram,<a name="FNanchor_ix:1_6" id="FNanchor_ix:1_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_ix:1_6" class="fnanchor">[ix:1]</a> expresst
in our <i>Transactions</i> for 1874, p. 454. My own words on pages 73,
64*,&mdash;written after short acquaintance with the play, and under stress
of Prof. Spalding's and Mr Hickson's able Papers, and the metrical
evidence&mdash;were incautiously strong. In modifying them now, I do but
follow the example of Prof. Spalding himself. Little as my opinion may
be worth, I wish to say that I think the metrical and æsthetic evidence
are conclusive as to there being two hands in the play. I do not think
the evidence that Shakspere wrote all the parts that either Prof.
Spalding or Mr Hickson assigns to him, at all conclusive. If it could be
shown that Beaumont<a name="FNanchor_ix:2_7" id="FNanchor_ix:2_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_ix:2_7" class="fnanchor">[ix:2]</a> or any other author wrote the suppos'd
Shakspere parts, and that Shakspere toucht them up, that theory would
suit me best. It failing, I accept, for the time, Shakspere as the
second author, subject to Fletcher having spoilt parts of his conception
and work.</p>

<p>Mr Swinburne, when duly clothed and in his right mind, and not exposing
himself in his April-Fool's cap and bells, will have something to say on
the subject; and it will no doubt be matter of controversy to the end of

<p>To Mrs Spalding and her family I am greatly obligd for their willing
consent to the present reprint. To Dr John Hill Burton, the Historian of

Spalding too I have to thank for help. And our Members, Mrs Bidder&mdash;the
friend of our lost sweet-natured helper and friend, Richard Simpson&mdash;and
Mr *****, for their gifts of £10 each, and the Rev. Stopford Brooke for
his gift of four guineas, towards the cost of the present volume.</p>

<p>To my friend Miss Constance O'Brien I am indebted for the annext Scheme

I only regret that the very large amount of his time&mdash;so much wanted for
other pressing duties,&mdash;which Mr Harold Littledale has given to his
extremely careful edition of <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i> for us, has thrown
on me, who know the Play so much less intimately than he does, the duty
of writing these <i>Forewords</i>. But we shall get his mature opinion in his

<p>also seeing no fancy even if there were fact in 'em, I applied to the
best judge in England known to me, Dr R. C. A. Prior, author of the
<i>Popular Names of British Plants</i>; and he says "I am quite at a loss for
the meaning of <i>cradles</i> and <i>death-beds</i> in the second stanza.</p>

<p>"The writer did not know much about plants, or he would not have
combined summer flowers, like the marigold and larkspur, with the
primrose.</p>

<p>"I prefer the reading 'With hair-bells dimme'; for nobody would call the
upright salver-shaped flower of the primrose a 'bell.' The poet probably
means the blue-bell."</p>

<p>On the other hand, Mr Wm Whale of our Egham Nurseries writes: "The
root-leaves of the Oxlip are cradle-shaped, but circular instead of
long. The growth of the leaves would certainly give one an idea of the
stem and Oxlip flowers being lodged in a cradle [? saucer].</p>

<p>"I have seen the marygold<a name="FNanchor_V:A_2" id="FNanchor_V:A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_V:A_2" class="fnanchor">[v:A]</a> in my boyish days frequently placed on

blowing rather later than others."</p></div>

<h2>LIFE OF PROFESSOR W. SPALDING,</h2>

<p class="p4">BY HIS SCHOOL-FELLOW AND FRIEND,</p>

<p class="p2">JOHN HILL BURTON, LL.D.,</p>

<p class="p4">AUTHOR OF 'THE HISTORY OF SCOTLAND,' ETC., ETC.</p>


<p>William Spalding was born on the 22nd of May in the year 1809, at
Aberdeen. His father was a practising lawyer as a member of the Society
of Advocates in that town, and held office as Procurator Fiscal of the
district, or local representative of the law officers of the crown, in
the investigation of crimes and the prosecution of criminals. Spalding's
mother, Frances Read, was well connected among the old and influential
families of the city. When he went to school, Spalding was known to be
the only son of a widow. He had one sister who died in early life.
Whatever delicacy of constitution he inherited seems to have come from
his father's side, for his mother lived to the year 1874, and died in
the house of her son's widow among her grown-up grandchildren.</p>

<p>Spalding had the usual school and college education of the district. He
attended the elementary burgh schools for English reading, writing, and
arithmetic, and passed on to Latin in the grammar school. In his day the
fees for attendance in that school, whence many pupils have passed into
eminence, were raised from 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> for each quarter of the
year. Those who knew Spalding in later life, would not readily
understand that as a school-boy he was noticeable for his personal
beauty. His features were small and symmetrical, and his cheeks had a
brilliant colour. This faded as he approached middle age, and the
features lost in some measure their proportions. He had ever a grave,
thoughtful, and acute face, and one of his favourite pupils records the
quick glance of his keen grey eye in the active duties of his class. He
was noticed in his latter years to have a resemblance to Francis and
Leonard Horner, and what Sydney Smith said of the older and more
distinguished of these brethren might have been said of Spalding's
earnest honest face, that "the commandments were written on his
forehead." When he had exhausted his five years' curriculum at the
grammar school, Spalding <!-- Page xiv --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv"></a>[<a href="./images/xiv.png">xiv</a>]</span>stepped on a November morning, with some of
his school-fellows, and a band of still more primitive youth, from the
Aberdeenshire moorlands, and the distant highlands, to enter the open
door of Marishal College, and compete for a bursary or endowment. This
arena of mental gladiatorship was open to all comers, without question
of age, country, or creed. The arrangement then followed&mdash;and no doubt
still in use, for it has every quality of fairness and effectiveness to
commend it, was this&mdash;An exercise was given out. It then consisted
solely of a passage in English of considerable length, dictated to and
written out by the competitors, who had to convert it into Latin. The
name of each competitor was removed from his exercise, and kept by a
municipal officer. A committee of sages, very unlikely to recognise any
known handwriting among the multitude of papers subjected to their
critical examination, sorted the exercises in the order of their merits,
and then the names of the successful competitors were found. My present
impression is that Spalding took the first bursary. It may have been the
second or the third, for occasionally a careless inaccuracy might trip
up the best scholar, but by acclamation the first place was assigned to
Spalding. Indeed, in a general way, through the whole course of his
education he swept the first prizes before him. When he finished the
four years' curriculum of Marishal College, he attended a few classes in
the college of Edinburgh, where the instruction was of another
kind&mdash;less absolute teaching, but perhaps opportunities for ascending
into higher spheres of knowledge. It was a little to the surprise of his
companions that he was next found undergoing those "Divinity Hall"
exercises, which predicate ambition to be ordained for the Church of
Scotland, with the prospect, to begin with, of some moorland parish with
a manse on a windy hill and a sterile but extensive glebe, a vista lying
beyond of possible promotion to the ministry of some wealthy and
hospitable civic community. Spalding said little about his views while
he studied for the Church, and nothing about his reasons for changing
his course, as he did, after a few months of study in his usual
energetic fashion. He had apparently no quarrel either with institutions
or persons, stimulating him to change his design, and he ever spoke
respectfully of the established Church of Scotland.</p>

<p>From this episodical course of study he brought with him some valuable
additions to the large stores of secular learning at his command. He had
a powerful memory, and great facilities for mastering and simplifying
sciences as well as languages. He seemed to say to himself, like Bacon,
"I have taken all knowledge to be my province." With any of his friends
who strayed into eccentric by-paths of inquiry he was <!-- Page xv --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv"></a>[<a href="./images/xv.png">xv</a>]</span>sarcastic&mdash;almost
intolerant, in denouncing their selection. Why abandon the great
literature&mdash;the great sciences and the great arts&mdash;which the noblest and
strongest intellects in all ages have combined to enrich and bring to
perfection? Master all that has been done in these, in the first place,
and then you may be permitted to take your devious course. In all the
departments of study he seemed to pass over the intermediate agencies,
to contemplate with something like worship the great leading spirits
whose intellectual stature raised them far above the mob. So in
literature, it was in Homer and Shakspeare that he delighted. In the
sciences connected with the analysis and the uses of intellect, he
looked to Aristotle, Hume, and Kant. In the exact sciences, to Galileo,
Tycho Brache and Newton, and so on. In art, he could admit the merits of
a Teniers, an Ostade, or a Morland, in accurately rendering nature, as
he would admit the merit of an ingenious toy. He could not but wonder at
the turbulent power of Rubens, but he was bitter on the purpose these
gifts were put to, in developing unsightly masses of flesh, and motions
and attitudes wanting alike in beauty and dignity. It was in Michel
Angelo, Raphael, and Thorwaldsen, with a select group from those
approaching near to these in their characteristic qualities, that the
young student selected the gods of his idolatry.</p>

<p>This love of art was something new in Spalding's native district. There
all forms of learning were revered, and many a striving rustic devoted
the whole energies of his life to acquire the means of teaching his
fellow-men from the pulpit or the printing press. But art was nought
among them. Spalding was thoroughly attached to his native district, and
could well have said, "I love my fathers' northern land, where the dark
pine trees grow;" but when his thoughts ran on art, he would sometimes
bitterly call the north of Scotland a modern Bœotia. This is not the
place for inquiring how it came to pass, that neglect of art could keep
company with an ardent love of letters, but it is remarkable that the
district so destitute of the æsthetic, gave to the world some
considerable artists. In the old days there was George Jameson; and in
Spalding's own generation, Bœotia produced Dyce, Giles, Philips, and
Cassy as painters, with Brodie as a sculptor. Spalding could not but see
merit in these, for none of them gave themselves to vulgar or purely
popular art. Still he panted after the higher altitudes, and it appeared
to him at one time that in his friend David Scot he had found the
practical master of his ideal field. Scot had, to be sure, grand
conceptions, but he did not possess the gift that enabled the great
masters to abstract them from the clay of the common world. He had the
defect&mdash;and his friend seeing it, felt it <!-- Page xvi --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi"></a>[<a href="./images/xvi.png">xvi</a>]</span>almost as a personal
calamity&mdash;of lapsing into the ungainly, and even the grotesque, in his
most aspiring efforts.</p>

<p>In approaching the time when the book to which this notice is prefixed
was published, one is tempted to offer a word or two of explanation on
its writer not appearing before the world earlier; and when he did
appear choosing so unobtrusive a fashion for his entry. About the time
when his college education ended, there was something like a revival of
literary ambition in Aberdeen, limited to young men who were Spalding's
contemporaries. A few of them appealed for the loudest blasts of the
trumpet of fame, in grand efforts in heroic and satirical poetry, and
their works may be found in the libraries of collectors curious in
specimens of forgotten provincial literature. These authors were
generally clever young men; and like others of their kind, they found in
after life that verse was not the only path to fame or fortune. One of
them became a distinguished pulpit orator. If Paley noticed, as an "only
defect" in a brother clergyman, that he was a popular preacher, Spalding
was apt to take a harsher view of such a failing; nor would he palliate
it on the representation of one who was the friend and admirer of both,
who pleaded the trials that a person so gifted is subjected to, noting
that there were certain eminences that the human head could not reach
without becoming dizzy&mdash;as, for instance, being Emperor of Russia,
Ambassador at an oriental court, Provost of a Scotch "Burgh toon"&mdash;or a
popular preacher. Another contemporary who courted and obtained
popularity, and still, to the joy of his friends, lives to enjoy it, was
less distasteful to Spalding, though trespassing on his own field of
ambition as a Greek scholar and Homeric critic. But he made the
distinction, that in this instance he thought the homage to popularity
was natural to the man, moving in irresistible impulses unregulated by a
system for bringing popularity in aid of success.</p>

<p>The lookers-on, knowing that Spalding was ambitious, expected to hear
him in the tuneful choir, but he was dumb. He was once or twice, by
those nearest to him, heard in song, and literally heard only, for it is
believed that he never allowed any manuscript testimony of such a
weakness to leave his custody. One satirical performance got popularity
by being committed to memory. It was called "The fire-balloon." In the
year 1828 there was an arousing of public sympathy with the sufferers by
a great conflagration at Merimachi in North America. A body of the
students who had imbibed from the Professor of Natural Philosophy an
enthusiasm about aerostation, proposed to raise money for the sufferers
by making and exhibiting a huge fire balloon. The effort was embarrassed
by many difficulties and adventures affording opportunity for the
satirist. <!-- Page xvii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii"></a>[<a href="./images/xvii.png">xvii</a>]</span>For instance, a trial trip was attempted, and one of "the
committee," who was the son of a clergyman, got hold of the key of his
father's church, and put its interior at the disposal of his colleagues.
The balloon inflated and ascended. The problem of getting it down again,
however, had not been solved. It got itself comfortably at rest in the
roof of a cupola, and the young philosophers then had to wait until it
became exhausted enough to descend.</p>

<p>The literary ambition of young Aberdeen found for itself a very sedate
and respectable looking organ in "<i>The Aberdeen Magazine</i>," published
monthly during the years 1831 and 1832, and still visible in two thick
octavo volumes. Spalding was not to be tempted into this project, though
there was a slight touch in it supposed, solely from internal evidence,
to have come from him. A heavy controversy was begun by one calling
himself "a classical reformer," who brought up foemen worthy of his
steel. At the end of the whole was a sting in a postscript, more
effective than anything in the unwieldy body it was attached to. <ins class="corr" title="original has extraneous quotation mark">P. S.</ins>
As I am no great scholar, perhaps your classical Reformer will have the
goodness to tell me where I can see <i>The Works of Socrates</i>. He seems to
allude to them twice [reference to pages]. As he modestly tells us that
he is a much better translator of Homer than Pope was, perhaps he will
be kind enough to favour the world with a translation, to use his own
words, of "those works which have immortalized the name of
Socrates."<a name="FNanchor_xvii:1_11" id="FNanchor_xvii:1_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_xvii:1_11" class="fnanchor">[xvii:1]</a></p>

<p>The papers in the Aberdeen Magazine were not all of the sombre cumbrous
kind. There was an infusion of fresh young blood, fired perhaps by the
influence of Wilson and Lockhart in Blackwood's Magazine, but seeking
original forms of its own. For the leader of this school, Spalding had
both esteem and admiration, but it was for far other merits than those
of the brisk unrestrained writer of fugitive literature. This was Joseph
Robertson, afterwards distinguished as an archæologist. He survived
Spalding eight years. No lines of study could well be in more opposite
directions than those of the two men who respected each other. While
Spalding revelled in all that was brightest and best in literature and
art, Robertson devoted himself to the development of our knowledge about
the period when the higher arts&mdash;those of the painter and the
sculptor&mdash;had been buried with the higher literature, and the classic
languages had degenerated, in the hands of those who, as Du Cange, whose
ample pages were often turned by Robertson, called them, were
"Scriptores mediæ et infimæ Latinitatis." The source of Spalding's
admiration was that Robertson's writing was perfect of its kind, and led
<!-- Page xviii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii"></a>[<a href="./images/xviii.png">xviii</a>]</span>to important and conclusive results. It was in this spirit that he
wrote his own "Letter." It did not fulfil a high aspiration, but it must
be perfect; and it was surely a moment of supreme happiness to him, when
he found the unknown author sought for and praised by so cautious and
reserved a critic as Hallam.</p>

<p>The "Letter" was published in 1833. It is characteristic of its author's
distaste of loud applause, that whenever this, his first achievement in
letters, saw the light, he fled, as it were, from the knowledge of what
was said of it, and wandered for several months in Italy and Germany.
This was an era in his life, for it gave him the opportunity of seeing
face to face, and profoundly studying, the great works of art that had
hitherto only been imaged in his dreams from copies and engravings. He
at the same time studied&mdash;or rather enjoyed&mdash;nature. In his native north
he had been accustomed to ramble among the Grampians at the head of the
Dee, where the precipices are from 1500 to 2000 feet high, and snow lies
all the year round. In these rambles he encountered hardships such as
one would hardly have thought within the capacity of his delicate frame.
He took the same method of enjoyable travelling in the Apennines&mdash;that
of the Pedestrian.</p>

<p>He gave to the world a slight morsel descriptive of his experiences and
enjoyments, in the Blackwood's Magazine of November, 1835. They were
told in so fine a spirit, so free both from ungraceful levity and solemn
pedantry, that the reader only regretted that they were too sparingly
imparted. He thus announced his own enjoyment in his pilgrimage: "Among
the ruined palaces and temples of Rome, and in the vineyards and
orange-groves beside the blue sea of Naples, I had warmed my imagination
with that inspiration which, once breathed upon the heart, never again
grows cold. It did not desert me now as I entered this upper valley of
the Apennines to seek a new colour and form of Italian landscape. Happy
and elevating recollections thronged in upon me, and blended with the
clear sunshine which slept on the green undulating hills." This fragment
is the only morsel of autobiographic information left by its author, and
therefore perhaps the following, taken from among many expressions of a
genial spirit enjoying itself in freedom, may not be unacceptable. He
has crossed the high-lying, bare plain of Rosetto, and reaches the
village of Val san Giovanni, where "shelter was heartily welcome, the
sun was set, snow-flakes were beginning to whirl in the air, and before
we reached the village, a sharp snow-storm had set in." Here he is
taking comfort to himself before a huge wood fire, when "a man entered
of superior dress and appearance to the <!-- Page xix --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix"></a>[<a href="./images/xix.png">xix</a>]</span>rest, and behind him bustled up
a little wretch in the government indirect-tax livery, who, never saying
by your leave, pushed a chair to the fire for his master. The gentleman
popped down, and turning to me, 'I am the Podestà,' said he. I made my
bow to the chief magistrate of the place. 'I am the Potestà,' said he
again, and our little squinting spy repeated reproachfully, 'His
excellency is the Podestà.'</p>

<p>"I was resolved not to understand what they would be at, and the
dignitary explained it to me with a copious use of circumlocution. He
said he had no salary from the government&mdash;this did not concern
me;&mdash;that he had it in charge to apprehend all vagabonds; this he seemed
to think might concern me. He asked for my passport, which was exhibited
and found right; and the Podestà proved the finest fellow possible.
These villagers then became curious to know what object I had in
travelling about among their mountains. My reader will by this time
believe me when I say that the question puzzled me. My Atanasio felt
that it touched his honour to be suspected of guiding a traveller who
could not tell what he travelled for. He took on him the task of reply.
Premising that I was a foreigner, and perhaps did not know how to
express myself, he explained that I was one of those meritorious
individuals who travel about discovering all the countries and the
unknown mountains, and putting all down on paper; and these individuals
always ask likewise why there are no mendicant friars in the country,
and which the peasants eat oftenest, mutton or macaroni? He added, with
his characteristic determined solemnity, that he had known several such
inquisitive travellers. This clear definition gave universal
satisfaction."<a name="FNanchor_xix:1_12" id="FNanchor_xix:1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_xix:1_12" class="fnanchor">[xix:1]</a></p>

<p>Soon after Spalding's return to Scotland, the late George Boyd, the
sagacious chief of the Firm of Oliver and Boyd, thought he might serve
him in a considerable literary project. It was the age of small books
published in groups&mdash;of "Constable's Miscellany," "Lardner's
Cyclopedia," "Murray's Family Library," and the like. With these Mr Boyd
thought he would compete, in the shape of the "Edinburgh Cabinet
Library," and Spalding was prevailed on to write for it three volumes,
with the title, "Italy and the Italian Islands." The bulk of the
contributions to such collections are mere compilations. But Scott,
Southey, Macintosh, and Moore had enlivened them with gifts from a
higher literature, and Spalding's contribution was well fitted to match
with the best of these, though he had to content himself in the ranks of
the compilers, until the discerning found a higher place for his book.</p>

<p>The same acute observer who had set him to this task found another <!-- Page xx --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx"></a>[<a href="./images/xx.png">xx</a>]</span>for
him in "The History of English Literature." The <i>Encyclopedia
Britannica</i> in the same manner drew him into contributions which
developed themselves into two works of great value, on "Logic," and on
"Rhetoric." That one of so original and self-relying a nature should
have thus been led by the influence of others into the chief labours of
his life, is explained by the intensity of his desire for perfection in
all he did. Once induced to lift his pen in any particular cause, he
could not lay it down again while there remained an incompleteness
unfilled, or an imperfection unremedied.</p>

<p>In a review on his book on Logic, having detected, from "various
internal symptoms of origin," the style and manner of a personal friend
of his own, he wrote to the culprit in this characteristic form, "very
many thanks for the notice. It may do good with some readers who don't
know the corrupt motives by which it was prompted: and it strikes me as
being exceedingly well and dexterously executed. I am quite sorry to
think how much trouble it must have cost you to pierce into the bowels
of the dry and dark territory, so far as the points you have been able
to reach. I am afraid also that you had to gutta-percha your conscience
a little, before it would stretch to some of your allegations, both
about the work and about the science. I see already so much that I could
myself amend&mdash;not in respect of doctrine, but in the manner of
exposition&mdash;as to make me regret that I am not in a place where the
classes of students are large enough to take off an edition, and so to
give me by and by the chance of re-writing the book. Yet it is
satisfactory to me to have got clearly the start of the publication of
Hamilton's Lectures, and so to anticipate&mdash;for some of the points on
which it will certainly be found that I have taken up ground of my
own&mdash;the attention of <i>some</i> of the few men who have written on the
science. Any of them who, having already looked into my book, shall
attempt to master Hamilton's system when it appears in his own statement
of it, are sure to find, if I do not greatly mistake, that I have raised
several problems, the discussion of which will require that my
suggestions be considered independently of Hamilton's, and my little
bits of theory either accepted or refuted. I dare say I told you that
early in the winter I had very satisfactory letters from Germany, and
you heard that the book was kindly taken by some of the Englishmen it
was sent to, and set on tooth and nail, though very amicably, by," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Let us go back to the chronology of his personal history, after his one
opportunity of seeing the world outside of Britain. He had joined the
Bar of Scotland before this episode in his life, and on his return he
took <!-- Page xxi --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi"></a>[<a href="./images/xxi.png">xxi</a>]</span>up the position of an advocate prepared for practice. This was no
idle ambitious attempt, for he had endured the drudgery of a solicitor's
office for the mastery of details, and had thoroughly studied the
substance of the law. His career now promised a great future. He was
affluent enough to spurn what Pope called "low gains;" he had good
connections, and became speedily a rising counsel. His career seemed to
be in the line of his friend Jeffrey's, taking all the honours and
emoluments of the profession, and occasionally relaxing from it in a
brilliant paper in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>.<a name="FNanchor_xxi:1_13" id="FNanchor_xxi:1_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_xxi:1_13" class="fnanchor">[xxi:1]</a> To complete the vista
of good fortune he took to be the domestic sharer of his fortunes a wife
worthy of himself&mdash;Miss Agnes Frier, born of a family long known and
respected on the Border. They were married on the 22nd of March in the
year 1838.</p>

<p>Perhaps some inward monitor told him that the fortunes before him were
too heavy to be borne by the elements of health and strength allotted to
him. It was to the surprise of his friends that in 1838 he abandoned the
bar, and accepted the chair of Rhetoric in Edinburgh. In 1845 he
exchanged it for the chair of Rhetoric and Logic at St Andrews. The
emoluments there were an inducement to him, since part of the property
of his family had been lost through commercial reverses over which he
had no control; and he was not one to leave anything connected with the
future of his family to chance. It was a sacrifice, for he left behind
him dear friends of an older generation, such as Jeffrey, Cockburn,
Hamilton, Wilson, and Pillans. Then there were half way between that
generation and his own, Douglas Cheape, Charles Neaves, and George Moir;
while a small body of his contemporaries sorely missed him, for he was a
staunch friend ever to be depended on. He was a <!-- Page xxii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii"></a>[<a href="./images/xxii.png">xxii</a>]</span>great teacher, and left
a well-trained generation of scholars behind him. The work of the
instructor, abhorred by most men, and especially by sensitive men, was
to him literally the "delightful task" of the poet who has endured many
a jibe for so monstrous a euphuism. Even while yet he was himself a
student, if he saw that a companion was wasting good abilities in
idleness or vapid reading, he would burden his own laborious hours with
attempts to stimulate his lazy friend. Just after he had passed through
the Greek class of Marishal College, a temporary teacher for that class
was required. Some one made the bold suggestion of trying the most
distinguished of the students fresh from the workshop, and Spalding
taught the class with high approval. As years passed on, the spirit of
the teacher strengthened within him. The traditions of the older
university were more encouraging to the drilling process than Edinburgh,
where the tendency was towards attractive lecturing. So entirely did the
teacher's duty at last absorb his faculties, that the phenomenon was
compared to the provisions in nature for compensating the loss by
special weaknesses or deficiencies, and that the scholar, conscious that
his own days of working were limited, instinctively felt that in
imparting his stores to others who would distribute them after he was
gone, he was making the most valuable use of his acquirements.</p>

<p>It was a mighty satisfaction to old friends in Edinburgh to hear that
Spalding had condescended to seek, and that he had found, that blessed
refuge of the overworked and the infirm, called a hobby. He was no
sportsman. The illustrious Golfing links of St Andrews were spread
before him in vain, though their attractions induced many a man to pitch
his tabernacle on their border, and it was sometimes consolatorily said
of Professors relegated to this arid social region, that they were
reconciling themselves to Golf. The days were long past for mounting the
knapsack and striding over the Apennines or even the Grampians.
Spalding's hobby was a simple one, but akin to the instincts of his
cultivated taste; it was exercised in his flower-garden. We may be sure
that he did not debase himself to the example of the stupid
floriculturist, the grand ambition of whose life is successfully to
nourish some prize monster in the shape of tulip or pansy. He allied his
gentle task of a cultivator of beautiful flowers, with high science, in
botany and vegetable physiology.</p>

<p>Besides such lighter alleviations, he had all the consolations that the
most satisfactory domestic conditions can administer to the sufferer. In
his later days he became afflicted with painful rheumatic attacks, and
the terrible symptoms of confirmed heart-disease. He died on the 16th of
November, 1859.</p>

OF THE DRAMA ENTITLED<br />
<br />
<i>THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN</i>.</h2>


<p>My dear L&mdash;&mdash;, We have met again, after an interval long enough to have
made both of us graver than we were wont to be. A few of my rarely
granted hours of leisure have lately been occupied in examining a
question on which your taste and knowledge equally incline and qualify
you to enter. Allow me to address to you the result of my inquiry, as a
pledge of the gratification which has been afforded me by the renewal of
our early intercourse.</p>

<p>Proud as <span class="smcap">Shakspeare's</span> countrymen are of his name, it is singular, though
not unaccountable, that at this day our common list of his works should
remain open to correction. <span class="sidenote">The list of <span class="smcap">Shakspere's</span> works is
not yet settled.</span> <span class="sidenote">Are all his in his publisht "<i>Works</i>"?</span>
Every one knows that some plays printed in his volumes have weak claims
to that distinction; but, while the exclusion even of works certainly
not his would now be a rash exercise of prerogative in any editor, it is
a question of more interest, whether there may not be dramas not yet
admitted among his collected works, which have a right to be there, and
might be inserted without the danger attending the dismissal of any
already put upon the list. <span class="sidenote">Six "Doubtful Plays:" none by
Shakspere.</span>A claim for admission has been set up in favour of Malone's
six plays,<a name="FNanchor_1:1_14" id="FNanchor_1:1_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_1:1_14" class="fnanchor">[1:1]</a> without any ground as to five of them, and <a name="FNanchor_1:2_15" id="FNanchor_1:2_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_1:2_15" class="fnanchor">[1:2]</a>with
very little to support it even for the sixth. <span class="sidenote">Ireland's
forgery, <i>Vortigern</i>.</span> <span class="sidenote">The folly of supposing <i>Vortigern</i>
genuine.</span>Ireland's impostures are an anomaly in literary history: even
the spell and sway of temporary fashion and universal opinion are causes
scarcely adequate to account for the blindness of the eminent men who
fell into the snare. The want of any external evidence in favour of the
<!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>[<a href="./images/2.png">2</a>]</span>first fabrication, the Shakspeare papers, was overlooked; and the
internal evidence, which was wholly against the genuineness, was
unhesitatingly admitted as establishing it. The play of 'Vortigern' had
little more to support it than the previous imposition.</p>

<p>There are two cases, however, in which we have external presumptions to
proceed from; for there are traditions traceable to Shakspeare's own
time, or nearly so, of his having assisted in two plays, still known to
us, but never placed among his works. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere said
(absurdly) to have helpt in Ben Jonson's <i>Sejanus</i>.</span>The one, the
'Sejanus', in which Shakspeare is said to have assisted Jonson, was
re-written by the latter himself, and published as it now stands among
his writings, the part of the assistant poet having been entirely
omitted; so that the question as to that play, a very doubtful question,
is not important, and hardly even curious. But the other drama is in our
hands as it came from the closets of the poets, and, if Shakspeare's
partial authorship were established, ought to have a place among his
works. <span class="sidenote"><i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i> attributed to Shakspere and
Fletcher; and rightly so.</span>It is, as you know, <span class="smcap">The Two Noble Kinsmen</span>,
printed among the works of Beaumont and Fletcher, and sometimes
attributed to <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> and <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> jointly. I have been able to
satisfy myself that it is rightly so attributed, and hope to be able to
prove to you, who are intimately conversant with Shakspeare, and
familiar also with the writings of his supposed co-adjutor, that there
are good grounds for the opinion. <span class="sidenote">It is unjustly excluded
from <i>Shakspere's Works</i>.</span>The same conclusion has already been reached
by others; but the discussion of the question cannot be needless, so
long as this fine drama continues excluded from the received list of
Shakspeare's works; and while there is reason to believe that there are
many discerning students and zealous admirers of the poet, to whom it is
known only by name. The beauty of the work itself will make much of the
investigation delightful to you, even though my argument on it may seem
feeble and stale.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">I. Historical or External Evidence.<br />
<br />
II. External Evidence, p. <a href="#Page_10">10</a>.</span></p>

<p>The proof is, of course, two-fold; the first branch emerging <a name="FNanchor_2:1_16" id="FNanchor_2:1_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_2:1_16" class="fnanchor">[2:1]</a>from
any records or memorials which throw light on the subject from without;
the second, from a consideration of the work itself, and a comparison of
its qualities with those of Shakspeare or Fletcher. You will keep in
mind, that it has not been doubted, and may be assumed, that Fletcher
had a share in the work; the only question <!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>[<a href="./images/3.png">3</a>]</span>is,&mdash;Whether Shakspeare
wrote any part of it, and what parts, if any?</p>

<p>The Historical Evidence claims our attention in the first instance; but
in no question of literary genuineness is this the sort of proof which
yields the surest grounds of conviction. <span class="sidenote">I. External
Evidence.</span>Such questions arise only under circumstances in which the
external proof on either side is very weak, and the internal evidence
has therefore to be continually resorted to for supplying the defects of
the external. It is true that a complete proof of a work having been
actually written by a particular person, destroys any contrary
presumption from intrinsic marks; and, in like manner, when a train of
evidence is deduced, showing it to be impossible that a work could have
been written by a certain author, no internal likeness to other works of
his can in the least weaken the negative conclusion. <span class="sidenote">
Historical evidence cannot exclude internal, unless the former is
complete.</span>In either case, however, the historical evidence must be
incontrovertible, before it can exclude examination of the internal; and
the two cases are by no means equally frequent. It scarcely ever happens
that there is external evidence weighty enough to establish certainly,
of itself, an individual's authorship of a particular work; but the
external proof that his authorship was impossible, may often be
convincing and perfect, from an examination of dates, or the like.
Since, therefore, external evidence against authorship admits of
completeness, we are entitled, when such evidence exclusively is founded
on, to demand that it shall be complete. Where by the very narrowest
step it falls short of a demonstration of absolute impossibility, the
internal evidence cannot be refused admittance in contravention of it,
and comes in with far greater force than that of the other. There may be
cases where authorship can be made out to the highest degree, at least,
of probability, by strong internal evidence coming in aid of an external
proof equally balanced for and against; and even where the extrinsic
proof is of itself sufficient <a name="FNanchor_3:1_17" id="FNanchor_3:1_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_3:1_17" class="fnanchor">[3:1]</a>to infer improbability, internal
marks may be so decided the opposite way, as to render the question
absolutely doubtful, or to occasion a leaning towards the affirmative
side. <span class="sidenote">Internal evidence the true test for <i>The Two N. K.</i></span>
These principles point out the internal evidence as the true ground on
which my cause must be contested; but it was not necessary to follow
them out to their full extent; for I can show you, <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[<a href="./images/4.png">4</a>]</span>that the external
facts which we have here, few as they are, raise a presumption in favour
of Shakspeare's authorship, as strong as exists in cases of more
practical importance, where its effect has never been questioned.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The Two N. K.</i> printed in 1634 as by Fletcher and
Shakspere.</span></p>

<p>The fact from which the maintainers of Shakspeare's share in this drama
have to set out, is the first printing of it, which took place in 1634.
In the title-page of this first edition,<a name="FNanchor_4:1_18" id="FNanchor_4:1_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_4:1_18" class="fnanchor">[4:1]</a> the play is stated to be
the joint work of Shakspeare and Fletcher. <span class="sidenote">Steevens's
doubts.</span> It is needless to enumerate categorically the doubts which have
been thrown, chiefly by the acute and perverse Steevens, on the credit
due to this assertion; for a few observations will show that they have
by no means an overwhelming force, while there are contrary presumptions
far more than sufficient to weigh them down. <span class="sidenote">A.D. 1634 was 18
years after Shakspere's death, 9 after Fletcher's.</span> The edition was not
published till eighteen years after Shakspeare's death, and nine years
after Fletcher's; but any suspicion which might arise from the length of
this interval, as giving an opportunity for imposture, is at once
removed by one consideration, which is almost an unanswerable argument
in favour of the assertion on the title-page, and in contravention of
this or any other doubts. <span class="sidenote">No motive to forge Shakspere's
name, as he (Sh.) had then fallen into neglect.</span> There was no motive for
falsely stating Shakspeare's authorship, because no end would have been
gained by it; for it is a fact admitting of the fullest proof, that,
even so recently after Shakspeare's death as 1634, he had fallen much
into neglect. Fletcher had become far more popular, and his name in the
title-page would have been a surer passport to public favour than
Shakspeare's. If either of the names was to be <a name="FNanchor_4:2_19" id="FNanchor_4:2_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_4:2_19" class="fnanchor">[4:2]</a>fabricated,
Fletcher's (which stands foremost in the title-page as printed) was the
more likely of the two to have been preferred. It appears then that the
time when the publisher's assertion of Shakspeare's authorship was made,
gives it a right to more confidence than it could have deserved if it
had been advanced earlier. If the work had been printed during the
poet's life, and the height of his popularity, its title-page would have
been no evidence at all. <!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[<a href="./images/5.png">5</a>]</span>And when the assertion is freed from the
suspicion of designed imposture, the truth of it is confirmed by its
stating the play to have been acted by the king's servants, and at the
Blackfriars. <span class="sidenote"><i>2 N. K.</i> acted at the Blackfriars (in whose
profits Shakspere had once a share).</span> It was that company which had been
Shakspeare's; the Globe and Blackfriars were the two theatres at which
they played; and at one or the other of these houses all his
acknowledged works seem to have been brought out. The fact of the play
not having been printed sooner, is accounted for by the dramatic
arrangements and practice of the time: the first collected edition of
Shakspeare's works, only eleven years earlier than the printing of this
play, contained about twenty plays of his not printed during his life;
and the long interval is a reason also why the printer and publisher are
different persons from any who were concerned in Shakspeare's other
works. The hyperbolical phraseology of the title-page is quite in the
taste of the day, and is exceeded by the quarto editions of some of
Shakspeare's admitted works.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Custom of authors writing plays together.</span></p>

<p>Was the alleged co-operation then in itself likely to have taken place?
It was. Such partnerships were very generally formed by the dramatists
of that time; both the poets were likely enough to have projected some
union of the kind, and to have chosen each other as the parties to it.
<span class="sidenote">Shakspere followed this custom, though rarely.</span> Although
Shakspeare seems to have followed this custom less frequently than most
of his contemporaries, we have reason to think that he did not wholly
refrain from it; and his favourite plan of altering plays previously
written by others, is a near approach to it. <span class="sidenote">Fletcher very
often.</span> As to Fletcher, his name is connected in every mind with that of
Beaumont; and the memorable and melancholy letter of the three
players,<a name="FNanchor_5:1_20" id="FNanchor_5:1_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_5:1_20" class="fnanchor">[5:1]</a> proves him to have coalesced with other writers even
during that poet's short <a name="FNanchor_5:2_21" id="FNanchor_5:2_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_5:2_21" class="fnanchor">[5:2]</a>life. This is of some consequence,
because, if the two poets wrote at the same time, it would seem that
they must have done so previously to Beaumont's death; for Shakspeare
lived only one year longer than <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[<a href="./images/6.png">6</a>]</span>Beaumont, and is believed to have spent
that year in the country. There is no proof that the drama before us was
not written before Beaumont's death (1615), and it is only certain that
its era was later than 1594. <span class="sidenote">Fletcher's co-authors.</span> After
the loss of his friend, Fletcher is said to have been repeatedly
assisted by Massinger: he joined in one play with Jonson and Middleton,
and in another with Rowley. <span class="sidenote">His sonship to a bishop, no
hindrance.</span> His superior rank (he was the son of a bishop) has been
gravely mentioned as discrediting his connection with Shakspeare; but
the same objection applies with infinitely greater force to his known
co-operation with Field, Daborne, and the others just named; and the
idea is founded on radically wrong notions of the temper of that age.
<span class="sidenote">Fletcher's burlesquing Shakspere is no argument against their
having written together.</span> There is scarcely more substance in a doubt
raised from the frequency with which Shakspeare is burlesqued by
Beaumont and Fletcher. Those satirical flings could have been no reason
why Fletcher should be unwilling to coalesce with Shakspeare, because
they indicate no ill feeling towards him. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere pokes fun
at Kyd, Peele, Marlowe.</span> They were practised by all the dramatic writers
at the expense of each other; Shakspeare himself is a parodist, and
indulges in those quips frequently, not against such writers only as the
author of the Spanish Tragedy, but against Peele and even Marlowe, his
own fathers in the drama, and both dead before he vented the jests,
which he never would have uttered had he attached to them any degree of
malice. And therefore also Fletcher's sarcasms cannot have disinclined
Shakspeare to the coalition, especially as his personal character made
it very unlikely that he should have taken up any such grudge as a testy
person might have conceived from some of the more severe.</p>

<p>But the circumstance on which most stress has been laid as disproving
Shakspeare's share in the drama in question, is this. <span class="sidenote">The <i>2
N. K.</i> not in the First Folio of Shakspere's Works, 1623, put forth by
Shakspere's fellows.</span> While the first edition of it was not printed till
1634, two editions of Shakspeare's collected works had been published
between the time of his death (1616) and that year, in neither of which
this play appears; and it is said that its omission in the first folio
(1623), in particular, is fatal to its claim, since Heminge and
<a name="FNanchor_6:1_22" id="FNanchor_6:1_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:1_22" class="fnanchor">[6:1]</a>Condell, who edited that collection, were Shakspeare's
fellow-actors and the executors of his will, and must be presumed to
have known perfectly what works were and what were not his. I have put
this objection <!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[<a href="./images/7.png">7</a>]</span>as strongly as it can be put; and at first sight it is
startling; but those who have most bibliographical knowledge of
Shakspeare's works, are best aware that much of its force is only
apparent. The omission in the second folio (1632) should not have been
founded on; for that edition is nothing but a reprint of the contents of
the first; and it is only the want of the play in this latter that we
have to consider. <span class="sidenote">But the First Folio is not of much
authority.</span> Now, you know well, that in taking some objections to the
authority of the First Folio, I shall only echo the opinions of
Shakspeare's most judicious critics. It was a speculation on the part of
the editors for their own advantage, either solely or in conjunction
with any others, who, as holders of shares in the Globe Theatre, had an
interest in the plays: for it was to the theatre, you will remark, and
not to Shakspeare or his heirs personally, that the manuscripts
belonged. <span class="sidenote">It was just a speculation for profit;</span> The edition
shews distinctly, that profit was its aim more than faithfulness to the
memory of the poet, in the correctness either of his text or of the list
of his works. Even the style of the preface excites suspicions which the
work itself verifies. <span class="sidenote">designd to put down the Quartos,</span>
<span class="sidenote">which yet it copies.</span> One object of it was to put down
editions of about fifteen separate plays of Shakspeare's, previously
printed in quarto, which, though in most respects more accurate than
their successors, had evidently been taken from stolen copies: the
preface of the folio, accordingly, strives to throw discredit on these
quartos, while the text, usually close in its adherence to them, falls
into errors where it quits them, and omits many very fine passages which
they give, and which the modern editors have been enabled by their
assistance to restore.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The Table of Contents of the First Folio of Shakspere's Works
is of less worth.</span></p>

<p>Here it is, however, of more consequence to notice, that the authority
of the Table of Contents of the Folio is worse than weak. The editors
profess to give all Shakspeare's works, and none which are not his: we
know that they have fulfilled neither the one pledge nor the other.
There is no doubt but they could at least have enumerated Shakspeare's
works correctly: but their knowledge and their design of profit did
<a name="FNanchor_7:1_23" id="FNanchor_7:1_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_7:1_23" class="fnanchor">[7:1]</a>not suit each other. <span class="sidenote">It lets in two Plays that are not
Shakspere's.</span> They have admitted, for plain reasons, two plays which are
not Shakspeare's. Their edition contains about twenty plays never before
printed; it was evidently their interest to enlarge this part of their
list as far as they safely could. <span class="sidenote"><i>1 Henry VI</i>,</span> The
pretended First Part of Henry VI., in <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[<a href="./images/8.png">8</a>]</span>which Shakspeare may perhaps have
written a single scene,<a name="FNanchor_8:1_24" id="FNanchor_8:1_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_8:1_24" class="fnanchor">[8:1]</a> but certainly not twenty lines besides, had
not been printed, and could be plausibly inserted; it does not seem that
they could have had any other reasons for giving it a place. <span class="sidenote">
and <i>Titus Andronicus</i>.</span>The Tragedy of the Shambles, which we call
'Titus Andronicus,' if it had been printed at all, had been so only
once, and that thirty years before; therefore it likewise was a novelty;
and a pretext was easily found for its admission. The editors then were
unscrupulous and unfair as to the works which they inserted: professing
to give a full collection, they were no less so as to those which they
did not insert. <span class="sidenote"><i>Troilus and Cressida</i></span> 'Troilus and
Cressida,' an unpleasing drama, contains many passages of the highest
spirit and poetical richness, and the bad in it, as well as the good, is
perfectly characteristic of Shakspeare; it is unquestionably his.
<span class="sidenote">is not in the Table of Contents.</span> It does not appear in
Heminge and Condell's table of contents, and is only found appended,
like a separate work, to some copies of their edition. Its pages are not
even numbered along with the rest of the volume; and if the first
editors were the persons who printed it, it was clearly after the
remainder of the work. If they did print it, their manner of doing so
shews their carelessness of truth more strongly than if they had omitted
it altogether. They first make up their list, and state it as a full one
without that play, which they apparently had been unable to obtain; they
then procure access to the manuscript, print the play, and insert it in
the awkward way in which it stands, and thus virtually confess that the
assertion in their preface, made in reference to their table of
contents, was untrue. At any rate, a part of their impression was
circulated without this play. <span class="sidenote"><i>Pericles</i> is not in the
volume, and yet is in part Shakspere's.</span> 'Pericles' also is wholly
omitted by those editors; it appears for the first time in the third
folio (1666), an edition of no value, and its genuineness rests much on
the internal proofs, which <a name="FNanchor_8:2_25" id="FNanchor_8:2_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_8:2_25" class="fnanchor">[8:2]</a>are quite sufficient to establish it. It
is an irregular and imperfect play, older in form than any of
Shakspeare's; but it has clearly been augmented by many passages written
by him, and therefore had a right to be inserted by the first editors,
upon their own principles. <span class="sidenote">The editors of the First Folio put
forth an incomplete book.</span> These two plays then being certainly
Shakspeare's, no matter whether his best or his worst, and his editors
being so situated that <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[<a href="./images/9.png">9</a>]</span>they must have known the fact, their edition is
allowed to appear as a complete collection of Shakspeare's works,
although its contents include neither of the two. They probably were
unable to procure copies; but they were not the less bound to have
acknowledged in their preface, that these, or any other plays which they
knew to be Shakspeare's, were necessary for making up a complete
collection. It in no view suited their purposes to make such a
statement; and it was not made. <span class="sidenote">We cannot trust the Editors
of the First Folio.</span> In short, the whole conduct of these editors
inspires distrust, but their unacknowledged omission of those two plays
deprives them of all claim to our confidence. The effect of that
omission, in reference to any play which can be brought forward as
Shakspeare's, is just this, that the want of the drama in their edition,
is of itself no proof whatever that Shakspeare was not the author of it,
and leaves the question, whether he was or was not, perfectly open for
decision on other evidence. It leaves the inquiry before us precisely in
that situation. Why Heminge and Condell could not procure the
manuscripts of 'Troilus,' 'Pericles,' or the 'Two Noble Kinsmen,' I am
not bound to shew. As to the last, Fletcher may have retained a partial
or entire right of property in it, and was alive at the publication of
their edition. Difficulties at least as great attach to the question as
to the other two rejected plays, in which the strength of the other
proofs has long been admitted as counterbalancing them. But the argument
serves my purpose without any theory on the subject. <span class="sidenote">The
First Folio no evidence against <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>.</span> The state of
it entitles me, as I conceive, to throw the First Folio entirely out of
view, as being no evidence one way or the other.</p>

<p>Laying the folio aside then, I think I have shewn that, in the most
unfavourable view, no doubts which other circumstances can throw on the
assertion made in the title-page of the first edition of the 'Two Noble
Kinsmen,' are of such strength as to ren<a name="FNanchor_9:1_26" id="FNanchor_9:1_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_9:1_26" class="fnanchor">[9:1]</a>der the truth of it
improbable. <span class="sidenote">Strong internal evidence will prove it in part
Shakspere's.</span> Strong internal evidence therefore will, in any view,
establish Shakspeare's claim. But, if the consideration first suggested
be well-founded, (as I have no doubt it is,) namely, that the statement
of the publisher was disinterested, there arises a very strong external
presumption of the truth of his assertion, which will enable us to
proceed to the examination of the internal marks with a prepossession in
favour of Shakspeare's authorship.</p>

<p><!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[<a href="./images/10.png">10</a>]</span>
As I wish to make you a convert to the affirmative opinion, it may be
wise to acquaint you that you will not be alone in it, if you shall
finally see reason to embrace it. <span class="sidenote">Early annotators on
Shakspere narrow-minded.</span> Shakspeare, you know, suffered a long eclipse,
which left him in obscurity till the beginning of last century, when he
reappeared surrounded by his annotators, a class of men who have
followed a narrow track, but yet are greater benefactors to us than we
are ready to acknowledge. The commentators have given little attention
to the question before us; but some of the best of them have declared
incidentally for Shakspeare's claim; and though even the editors who
have professed this belief have not inserted the work as his, this is
only one among many evil results of the slavish system to which they all
adhere. <span class="sidenote">Yet Pope, Warburton, Farmer, believe <i>The Two Noble
Kinsmen</i> genuine: so does Schlegel.</span> We have with us Pope, Warburton,
and above all, Farmer, a man of fine discernment, and a most cautious
sifter of evidence. The subject has more recently been treated shortly
by a celebrated foreign critic, the enthusiastic and eloquent
Schlegel,<a name="FNanchor_10:1_27" id="FNanchor_10:1_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_10:1_27" class="fnanchor">[10:1]</a> who comes to a conclusion decidedly favourable to
Shakspeare.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="sidenote">II. Internal evidence.</span></p>

<p>There still lies before us the principal part of our task, that of
applying to the presumption resulting from the external proof, (whatever
the amount of that may be,) the decisive test of the <a name="FNanchor_10:2_28" id="FNanchor_10:2_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_10:2_28" class="fnanchor">[10:2]</a>Internal
Evidence. Do you doubt the efficacy of this supposed crucial experiment?
It is true that internal similarities form almost a valueless test when
applied to inferior writers; because in them the distinctive marks are
too weak to be easily traced. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's work specially fit
for the Internal Evidence test.</span> But, in the first place, great authors
have in their very greatness the pledge of something peculiar which
shall identify their works, and consequently the test is usually
satisfactory in its application to them; and, secondly and particularly,
Shakspeare is, of all writers that have existed, that one to whose
alleged works such a test can be most confidently administered; because
he is not only strikingly <!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[<a href="./images/11.png">11</a>]</span>peculiar in those qualities which
discriminate him from other poets, but his writings also possess
singularities, different from, and opposite to, the usual character of
poetry itself.</p>

<p>I cannot proceed with you to the work itself, till I have reminded you
of some distinctive differences between the two writers whose claims we
are to adjust, the recollection of which will be indispensable to us in
considering the details of the drama. <span class="sidenote">Differences between
Shakspere and Fletcher to be discusst.</span> We shall then enter on that
detailed examination, keeping those distinctions in mind, and attempting
to apply them to individual passages; and, when all the scenes of the
play have thus passed successively before us, we shall be able to look
back on it as a whole, and investigate its general qualities.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="sidenote">Shakspere's and Fletcher's versification contrasted.</span></p>

<p>The first difference which may be pointed out between Shakspeare and
Fletcher, is that of their versification. You have learned from a study
of the poets themselves, in what that difference consists. <span class="sidenote">
Shakspere's.</span>Shakspeare's versification is broken and full of pauses,
he is sparing of double terminations to his verses, and has a marked
fondness for ending speeches or scenes with hemi-stitches. <span class="sidenote">
Fletcher's.</span>Fletcher's rhythm is of a newer and smoother cast, often
keeping the lines distinct and without breaks through whole speeches,
abounding in double endings, and very seldom leaving a line incomplete
at the end of a sentence or scene.<a name="FNanchor_11:1_29" id="FNanchor_11:1_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_11:1_29" class="fnanchor">[11:1]</a> And the opposite taste of the
two poets in their choice and arrangement <a name="FNanchor_11:2_30" id="FNanchor_11:2_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_11:2_30" class="fnanchor">[11:2]</a>of words, gives an
opposite character to the whole modulation of their verses. <span class="sidenote">
Modulation of Fletcher's verse: of Shakspere's.</span>Fletcher's is sweet and
flowing, and peculiarly fitted either for declamation or the softness of
sorrow: Shakspeare's ear is tuned to the stateliest solemnity of
thought, or the abruptness and vehemence of passion. The present drama
exhibits in whole scenes the qualities of Shakspeare's versification;
and there are other scenes which are marked by those of Fletcher's; the
difference is one reason for separating the authorship.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Shakspere's images and words in <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>.</span></p>

<p>You will notice in this play many instances of Shakspeare's favourite
images, and of his very words. Is this a proof of the play having been
his work, or does it only indicate imitation? In <!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[<a href="./images/12.png">12</a>]</span>Shakspeare's case,
such resemblance, taken by itself, can operate neither way. <span class="sidenote">
Shakspere a mannerist in style, and</span>Shakspeare is a mannerist in style.
He knew this himself, and what he says of his minor poems, is equally
true of his dramatic language; he "keeps invention in a noted
weed<a name="FNanchor_12:1_31" id="FNanchor_12:1_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_12:1_31" class="fnanchor">[12:1]</a>;" and almost every word or combination of words is so marked
in its character that its author is known at a glance. <span class="sidenote">
wanting in variety. Shakspere repeats himself.</span>But not only is his
style so peculiar in its general qualities, as scarcely to admit of
being mistaken; not only is it deficient in variety of structure, but it
is in a particular degree characterised by a frequent recurrence of the
same images, often clothed in identically the same words. You are quite
aware of this, and those who are not, may be convinced of it by opening
any page of the annotated editions. So far, then, this play is only like
Shakspeare's acknowledged works. It is true, that one who wished to
write a play in Shakspeare's manner, would probably have repeated his
images and words as they are repeated here; but Shakspeare would
certainly have imitated himself quite as often. <span class="sidenote">The likeness
to Shakspere in <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, and the repetitions of him, are
likely to be by him.</span> The resemblance could be founded on, as indicating
imitation, only in conjunction with other circumstances of dissimilarity
or inferiority to his genuine writings; and where, as in the present
case, there seems to be reason for asserting that the accompanying
circumstances point the work out as an original composition of his, this
very likeness and repetition become a strong argument in support of
those concomitant indications. <a name="FNanchor_12:2_32" id="FNanchor_12:2_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_12:2_32" class="fnanchor">[12:2]</a>Such repetition is more or less
common in all the play-writers of that age. The number of their works,
the quickness with which they were written, and the carelessness which
circumstances induced as to their elaboration or final correction, all
aided in giving rise to this. <span class="sidenote">Massinger also repeats himself
much.</span> <span class="sidenote">Fletcher but little.</span> But all are not equally
chargeable with it; Beaumont and Fletcher less than most, Massinger to
an extent far beyond Shakspeare, and vying with the common-places of
Euripides. May not the professional habits of Shakspeare and Massinger
as actors, have had some effect in producing this, by imprinting their
own works in their memories with unusual strength? Fletcher and his
associate were free from that risk.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Singularity of Shakspere's style.</span></p>

<p>It would not be easy to give a systematic account of those <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[<a href="./images/13.png">13</a>]</span>qualities
which combine to constitute Shakspeare's singularity of style. Some of
them lie at the very surface, others are found only on a deeper search,
and a few there are which depend on evanescent relations, instinctively
perceptible to the congenial poetical sense, but extremely difficult of
abstract prose definition. Several qualities also, which we are apt to
think exclusively his, (such, for instance, as his looseness of
construction,) are discovered on examination to be common to him with
the other dramatic writers of his age. Such qualities can give no
assistance in an inquiry like ours, and may be left wholly out of view.
But I think the distinctions which I can specify between him and
Fletcher are quite enough, and applicable with sufficient closeness to
this drama, for making out the point which I wish to prove.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Qualities of Shakspere's style: energy, obscurity,
abruptness, brevity (in late plays).</span></p>

<p>No one is ignorant that Shakspeare is concise, that this quality makes
him always energetic and often most impressive, but that it also gives
birth to much obscurity. He shows a constant wish to deliver thought,
fancy, and feeling, in the fewest words possible. Even his images are
brief; they are continual, and they crowd and confuse one another; the
well-springs of his imagination boil up every moment, and the readiness
with which they throw up their golden sands, makes him careless of fitly
using the wealth thus profusely rendered. He abounds in hinted
descriptions, in sketches of imagery, in glimpses of illustration, in
abrupt and vanishing snatches of fancy. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere never
vague.</span> But the merest hint that he gives is of force <a name="FNanchor_13:1_33" id="FNanchor_13:1_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_13:1_33" class="fnanchor">[13:1]</a>enough to
shew that the image was fully present with him; if he fails to bring it
as distinctly before us, it is either from the haste with which he
passes to another, or from the eagerness induced by the very force and
quickness with which he has conceived the former. <span class="sidenote">Milton and
language.</span> It has been said of Milton that language sunk under him; and
it is true of him in one sense, but of Shakspeare in two. <span class="sidenote">
Shakspere's new meanings and new words.</span>Shakspeare's strength of
conception, to which, not less than to Milton's, existing language was
inadequate, compelled him either to use old words in unusual meanings,
or to coin new words for himself.<a name="FNanchor_13:2_34" id="FNanchor_13:2_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_13:2_34" class="fnanchor">[13:2]</a> But his mind had another quality
powerful over his style, <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[<a href="./images/14.png">14</a>]</span>which Milton's wanted. <span class="sidenote">Milton
slow,</span> <span class="sidenote">Shakspere rapid,</span> Milton's conception was
comparatively slow, and allowed him time for deliberate expression:
Shakspeare's was rapid to excess, and hurried his words after it. When a
truth presented itself to his mind, all its qualities burst in upon him
at once, and his instantaneousness of conception could be represented
only by words as brief and quick as thought itself. <span class="sidenote">specially
in reflective passages.</span> This cause operates with the greatest force on
his passages of reflection; for if his images are often brief, his
apophthegms are brief a thousand times oftener: his quickness of ideas
seems to have been stimulated to an extraordinary degree by the
contemplation of general truths. <span class="sidenote">He forces speech to bear a
burden beyond its strength.</span> And everywhere his incessant activity and
quickness, both of intellect and fancy, engaged him in a continual
struggle with speech; it is a sluggish slave which he would force to
bear a burden beyond its strength, a weary courser which he would urge
at a speed to which it is unequal. He fails only from insufficiency in
his puny instrument; not because his conception is indistinct, but
because it is too full, energetic, and rapid, to receive adequate
expression. It is excess of strength which hurts, not weakness which
incapacitates; he is injured by the undue prevalence of the good
principle, not by its defect. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's obscurity.</span> The
obscurity of other writers is often the mistiness of the evening
twilight sinking into night; his is the fitful dimness of the dawn,
contending with the retiring darkness, and striving to break out
<a name="FNanchor_14:1_35" id="FNanchor_14:1_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_14:1_35" class="fnanchor">[14:1]</a>into open day. <span class="sidenote">Fletcher most unlike Shakspere.</span>
Scarcely any writer of Shakspeare's class, or of any other, comes near
him either in the faults or the grandeur which are the alternate results
of this tendency of mind; but none is more utterly unlike him than the
poet to whom, some would say, we must attribute passages in this play so
singularly like Shakspeare. <span class="sidenote">Fletcher diffuse.</span> Fletcher is
diffuse both in his leading thoughts and in his illustrations.
<span class="sidenote">He amplifies, is elaborate, not vigorous.</span> His intellect did
not present truth to him with the instant conviction which it poured on
Shakspeare, and his fancy did not force imagery on him with a profusion
which might have tempted him to weave its different suggestions into
inconsistent forms; he expresses thought deliberately and with
amplification; he paints his illustrative pictures with a careful hand
and by repeated touches; <!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[<a href="./images/15.png">15</a>]</span>his style has a pleasing and delicate air
which is any thing but vigorous, and often reaches the verge of
feebleness. Take a passage or two from the work before us, and do you
say, who know Fletcher, whether they be his, or the work of a stronger
hand.</p>

<p>Is this like Fletcher? I think not. It is unlike him in versification
and in the tone of thought; and you will here particularly notice <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[<a href="./images/16.png">16</a>]</span>that
it is unlike him in abruptness and brevity. It is like Shakspeare in all
these particulars.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Shakspere hardly ever vague,</span></p>

<p>I have said that Shakspeare, often obscure, is scarcely ever vague; that
he may fail to express all he wishes, but almost always gives distinctly
the part which he is able to convey. <span class="sidenote">Fletcher unable to grasp

vague and deficient in precision. The following lines are taken from a
scene in the play under our notice, which clearly is not Shakspeare's. I
would direct your attention, not to the remoteness of the last conceit,
but to the want of distinctness in grasping images, and the inability to
see fully either their picturesque or their poetical relations.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Shakspere metaphorical, but seldom has long description.</span></p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_16:1_39" id="FNanchor_16:1_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_16:1_39" class="fnanchor">[16:1]</a>Shakspeare's style, as every one knows, is metaphorical to excess.
<span class="sidenote">His thought and imagination work together.</span> His imagination
is always active, but he seldom pauses to indulge it by lengthened
description. I shall hereafter have occasion to direct your observation
to the sobriety with which he preserves imagination in its proper
station, as only the minister and interpreter of thought; but what I
wish now to say is, that in him the two powers operate simultaneously.
He goes on thinking vigorously, while his imagination scatters her
inexhaustible treasures like flowers on the current of his meditations.
His constant aim is the expression of facts, passions, or opinions; and
his intellect is constantly occupied in the investigation of such; but
the mind acts with ease in its lofty vocation, and the beautiful and the
grand rise up voluntarily to do him homage. He never indeed consents to
express those poetical ideas by themselves; but he shows that he felt
their import and their <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[<a href="./images/17.png">17</a>]</span>legitimate use, by wedding them to the thoughts
in which they originated. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's truths and their
imagery glorify one another.</span> The truths which he taught, received
magnificence and amenity from the illustrative forms; and the poetical
images were elevated into a higher sphere of associations by the dignity
of the principles which they were applied to adorn. <span class="sidenote">Metaphor
the strength of poetry; simile its weakness.</span> Something like this is
always the true function of the imagination in poetry, and dramatic
poetry in particular; and it is also the test which tries the presence
of the faculty; metaphor indicates its strength, and simile its
weakness. <span class="sidenote">Fletcher is diffuse in description and simile,</span>
<span class="sidenote">loses the original thought in it,</span> Nothing can be more
different from this, or farther inferior to it, than the style of a poet
who turns aside in search of description, and indulges in simile
preferably to the brevity of metaphor, to whom perhaps a poetical
picture originally suggested itself as the decoration of a striking
thought, but who allowed himself to be captivated by the beauty of the
suggested image, till he forgot the thought which had given it birth,
and on its connexion with which its highest excellence depended.
<span class="sidenote">is poor in metaphor, and picturesque.</span> Such was Fletcher,
whose style is poor in metaphor. His descriptions are sometimes
beautifully romantic; but even then the effect of the whole is often
picturesque rather than poetically touching; and it is evident that
lengthened description can still less frequently be dramatic. In his
descriptions, it is observable that the poetical relations introduced in
illustration <a name="FNanchor_17:1_40" id="FNanchor_17:1_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_17:1_40" class="fnanchor">[17:1]</a>are usually few, the character of the leading subject
being relied on for producing the poetical effect. <span class="sidenote">Fletcher's
and Shakspere's descriptions contrasted.</span> Fletcher's longest
descriptions are but elegant outlines; Shakspeare's briefest metaphors
are often finished paintings. Where Shakspeare is guilty of detailed
description, he is very often laboured, cold, and involved; but his
illustrative ideas are invariably copious, and it is often their
superfluity which chiefly tends to mar the general effect. <span class="sidenote"> Metaphor in
<i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i></span> <span class="sidenote">is Shakspere's.</span> In the play that you are to
examine, you will find a profusion of metaphor, which is undoubtedly the
offspring of a different mind from Fletcher's; and both its excellence
and its peculiarity of character seem to me to stamp it as Shakspeare's.
I think the following passage cannot be mistaken, though the beginning
is difficult, and the text perhaps incorrect.</p>

frequency, like his in their tone and character, and like his in their
occasional obscurity and blending together.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Shakspere's classical images.</span></p>

<p>We have been looking to Shakspeare's imagery. You will meet with
classical images in the 'The Two Noble Kinsmen.' Do not allow any
ill-applied notion of his want of learning to convert this into an
argument against his authorship. You will recollect, that an attachment
of this sort is very perceptible in Shakspeare's dramas, and pervades
the whole thread of his youthful poems. It is indeed a prominent quality
in the school of poetry, which prevailed during the earlier part of his
life, perhaps during the whole of it. In his early days, the study of
<a name="FNanchor_18:1_41" id="FNanchor_18:1_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_18:1_41" class="fnanchor">[18:1]</a>Grecian and Latin literature in England may be said to have only
commenced, and the scenery and figures of the classical mythology broke
on the view of the student with all the force of novelty. <span class="sidenote">
Elizabethan literature tinged with classicism.</span>All the literature of
that period is tinged with classicism to a degree which in our satiated
times is apt to seem pedantic. It infected writers of all kinds and
classes: translations were multiplied, and a familiarity with classical
tales and history was sought after or affected even by those who had no
access to the original language. Shakspeare clearly stood in this latter
predicament, his knowledge of Latin certainly not exceeding that of a
schoolboy: but the translated classics enabled him to acquire the facts,
and he shared the taste of the age to its full extent. <span class="sidenote">
Shakspere's classical allusions.</span>His admiration of the classical
writers is vouched by the subjects and execution of his early poems, by
numerous allusions in his dramas, particularly his histories, by the
subjects chosen for some <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[<a href="./images/19.png">19</a>]</span>of his plays, by one or two imitations of the
translated Latin poets,<a name="FNanchor_19:1_42" id="FNanchor_19:1_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_19:1_42" class="fnanchor">[19:1]</a> and by many exotic forms in his language,
derived from the same secondary source. Correct tameness is the usual
character of classical allusion in authors well versed in classical
studies. <span class="sidenote">Milton's classical allusions.</span>
<span class="sidenote">Fletcher's.</span>Even Milton, who has drawn the most exquisite images of
this kind, has sometimes remembered only, where he should have invented:
and Fletcher, whom we have especially to consider, is no exception to
the rule; his many classical illustrations are invariably cold and poor.
<span class="sidenote">Shakspere's treatment of mythology.</span> Shakspeare's
mythological images have something singular in them. They are incorrect
as transcripts of the originals, but admirable if examined without such
reference; they are highly-coloured paintings whose subjects are taken
from the simplicity of some antique statue. <span class="sidenote">His <i>Venus and
Adonis</i>.</span> The 'Venus and Adonis' has some fine and some overcharged
pictures thus formed from the hints which he derived from his
books.<a name="FNanchor_19:2_43" id="FNanchor_19:2_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_19:2_43" class="fnanchor">[19:2]</a> He received the mythological images but imperfectly, and
his fancy was stimulated without being <a name="FNanchor_19:3_44" id="FNanchor_19:3_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_19:3_44" class="fnanchor">[19:3]</a>clogged. <span class="sidenote">
Shakspere's treatment of classical mythology;</span>He stood but at the
entrance of those visionary forests, within whose glades the heroes and
divinities of ancient faith reposed; he looked through a glimmering and
uncertain light, and caught only glimpses of the sanctity of that world
of wonders: and it was with an imagination heated by the flame of
mystery and partial ignorance that he turned away from the scene so
imperfectly revealed, to brood on the beauty of its broken contours, and
allow fancy to create magnificence richer than memory ever saw. The
occurrence of classical allusions here, therefore, affords no reason for
doubting his authorship even of those passages in which they are found:
and if we could trace any of his singularities in the images which we
have, the argument in his favour would be strengthened by these. Most of
the allusions are too slightly sketched to permit this; but one or two
are like him in their unfaithfulness. We have "Mars' drum" in the 'Venus
and Adonis'; and here beauty is described as able to make him spurn it:
the altar of the same <!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[<a href="./images/20.png">20</a>]</span>deity is alluded to as the scene of a Grecian
marriage. The "Nemean lion's hide" is here, as his nerve in 'Hamlet.'
<span class="sidenote">specially in Arcite's prayer in Act V. scene i.</span> But the most
characteristic use of this sort of imagery is in the prayer in the first
scene of the Fifth Act. <span class="sidenote">This scene is certainly Shakspere's.</span>
The whole tenor of the language, the solemnity and majesty of the tone
of thought, the piling up of the heap of metaphors and images, and the
boldness and admirable originality of their conception, all these are
Shakspeare's; and the fact of this accumulation of feeling, thought, and
imagination, being employed to create, out of a fragmentary classical
outline, a picture both new in its features and gorgeously magnificent
in its filling up, is strongly indicative of his hand, and strikingly
resembles his mode of dealing with such subjects elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Shakspere's tendency to reflection.</span></p>

<p>You will be furnished with a rule to guide your decision on many
passages of the drama otherwise doubtful, by having your notice slightly
directed to what will fall more properly under our consideration when we
look back on the general scope of the play,&mdash;I mean Shakspeare's
prevailing tendency to reflection. The presence of a spirit of active
and inquiring thought through every page of his writings is too evident
to require any proof. It is exerted on every object which comes under
his notice: it is serious when its theme is lofty; and when the subject
is familiar, <a name="FNanchor_20:1_45" id="FNanchor_20:1_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_20:1_45" class="fnanchor">[20:1]</a>it is contented to be shrewd. <span class="sidenote">His own
active and inquiring thought, is the only quality of his own that he's
given <i>all</i> his characters.</span> He has impressed no other of his own mental
qualities on all his characters: this quality colours every one of them.
It is one to which poetry is apt to give a very subordinate place: and,
in most poets, fancy is the predominating power; because, immeasurably
as that faculty in them is beneath its unequalled warmth in Shakspeare,
yet intellect in them is comparatively even weaker. With inferior poets,
particularly the dramatic, inflation of feeling and profusion of imagery
are the alternate disguises which conceal poverty of thought. <span class="sidenote">
Fletcher's thought, small beside Shakspere's.</span>Fletcher is a poet of
much and sterling merit; but his fund of thought is small indeed when
placed beside Shakspeare's. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's worldly wisdom, and
solemn thought.</span> He has, indeed, very little of Shakspeare's practical,
searching, worldly wisdom, and none of that solemnity of thought with
which he penetrates into his loftier themes of reflection. <span class="sidenote">
Shakspere's Imagination the handmaid of his Understanding.</span>This quality
in Shakspeare is usually relieved by poetical decoration: Imagination is
active powerfully <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>[<a href="./images/21.png">21</a>]</span>and unceasingly, but she is rebuked by the presence
of a mightier influence; she is but the handmaid of the active and
piercing Understanding; and the images which are her offspring serve but
as the breeze to the river, which stirs and ripples its surface, but is
not the power which impels its waters to the sea. As you go through this
drama, you will not only find a sobriety of tone pervading the more
important parts of it, but activity of intellect constantly exerted.
<span class="sidenote">Note the mass of general truths and maxims in this part of
<i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>.</span> But what demands particular notice is, the
mass of general truths, of practical, moral, or philosophical maxims,
which, issuing from this reflective turn of mind, are scattered through
Shakspeare's writings as thick as the stars in heaven. The occurrence of
them is characteristic of his temper of mind; and there is something
marked in the manner of the adages themselves. They are often solemn,
usually grave, but always pointed, compressed, and energetic;&mdash;they vary
in subject, from familiar facts and rules for social life to the
enunciation of philosophical truths and the exposition of moral duty.
You will meet with them in this drama in all their shapes and in every
page [of Shakspere's part of it].</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Shakspere's reach of thought.</span></p>

<p>Shakspeare's reach and comprehension of thought is as remarkable as its
activity, while Fletcher's is by no means great, and in this respect
Massinger comes much nearer to him. The simplest fact has many dependent
qualities, and may be related by <a name="FNanchor_21:1_46" id="FNanchor_21:1_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_21:1_46" class="fnanchor">[21:1]</a>men of different degrees of
intellect with circumstances differing infinitely, a confined mind
seeing only its plainest qualities, while a stronger one grasps and
combines many distant relations. Shakspeare's love of brevity would not
have produced obscurity nearly so often, had it not been aided by his
width of mental vision. <span class="sidenote">Passages in <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>
too comprehensive for Fletcher.</span> There are many passages in the play
before us which seem to emanate from a mind of more comprehension than
Fletcher's. Look at the following lines. The idea to be expressed was a
very simple one. Hippolita is entreating her husband to leave her, and
depart to succour the distressed ladies who kneel at her feet and his;
and she wishes to say, that though, as a bride, she was loth to lose her
husband's presence, yet she felt that she should act blameably if she
detained him. Fletcher would have expressed no idea beyond that; but on
it alone he would have employed six lines and two or three <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[<a href="./images/22.png">22</a>]</span>comparisons.
Hear how many cognate ideas present themselves to Shakspeare's mind in
expressing the thought. The passage is obscure, but not the less like
Shakspeare on that account.</p>

<p>It would be well if Shakspeare's continual inclination to thought gave
rise to no worse faults than occasional obscurity. It was not to be
hoped that it should not produce others. His tone of thinking could not
be always high and serious; and even when it flowed in a lofty channel,
its uninterrupted stream could not always be pure. <span class="sidenote">
Shakspere's conceits and quibbles.</span>His judgment often fails to perform
its part, and he is guilty of conceit and quibble, not merely in his
comic vein, but in his most deeply tragical situations. He has indeed
one powerful excuse; he had universal example in both respects to
justify or betray him. But he has likewise another plea, that his
constant activity of mind, and the wideness of its province, exposed him
to pe<a name="FNanchor_22:1_47" id="FNanchor_22:1_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_22:1_47" class="fnanchor">[22:1]</a>culiar risks. A mind always in action must sometimes act
wrongly; and the constant exercise of the creative powers of the mind
dulls the edge of the corrective. It was not strange that he who was
unwearied in tracing the manifestations of that spirit of likeness which
pervades nature, should often mistake a resemblance in name for a
community of essence,&mdash;that he whose mind was sensible to the most
delicate differences, should sometimes fancy he saw distinction where
there was none;&mdash;it was not strange, however much to be regretted, that
he who left the smooth green slopes of fancy to clamber among the craggy
steeps of thought, should often stumble in his dizzy track, either in
looking up to the perilous heights above, or downwards on the morning
landscape beneath him. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's faults.</span> While the most
glaring errors of the tropical Euphues are strained allegorical
conceits, Shakspeare's fault is oftener the devising of subtle and
unreal distinctions, or the ringing of fantastical changes upon words.
<span class="sidenote">Lyly's faults.</span> <!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[<a href="./images/23.png">23</a>]</span>Lily's error was one merely of taste;
Shakspeare's was one of the judgment, and the heavier of the two, but
still the error of a stronger mind than the other; for the judgment
cannot act till the understanding has given it materials to work upon,
and those fanciful writers who do not reflect at all, are in no danger
of reflecting wrongly. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's evil genius triumphs in
his puns.</span> Shakspeare's evil genius triumphs when it tempts him to a
pun&mdash;it enjoys a less complete but more frequent victory in suggesting
an antithesis; but it often happens that this dangerous turn of mind
does not carry him so far as to be of evil consequence. It aids its
quickness and directness of mental view, in giving to his style a
pointed epigrammatic terseness which is quite its own, and a frequent
weight and effect which no other equals. Where, however, this antithetic
tendency is allowed to approach the serious scenes, it throws over them
an icy air which is very injurious, while it often gives the comic ones
a ponderousness which is altogether singular, and but imperfectly
accordant with the nature of comic dialogue. <span class="sidenote">Characteristics
of his wit.</span> The arrows of Shakspeare's wit are not the lightly
feathered shafts which Fletcher discharges, and as little are they the
iron-headed bolts which fill the quiver of Jonson; but they are weapons
forged from materials unknown to the others, and in an armoury to which
they had no access; their execution is <a name="FNanchor_23:1_48" id="FNanchor_23:1_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_23:1_48" class="fnanchor">[23:1]</a>resistless when they reach
their aim, but they are covered with a golden massiveness of decoration
which sometimes impedes the swiftness of their flight. But whether the
effect of these peculiarities of Shakspeare be good or evil, their use
in helping an identification of his manner is very great. <span class="sidenote">
Contrast with Fletcher's.</span>Nothing can be more directly opposite to them
than the slow elegance and want of pointedness which we find in
Fletcher, who is not free from conceits, but does not express them with
Shakspeare's hard quaintness, while he is comparatively quite guiltless
of plays on words. The following instances are only a few among many in
the present drama, which seem to be perfectly in Shakspeare's manner,
and to most of which Fletcher's works could certainly furnish no
parallel, either in subject or in expression.</p>

Shakspeare's fondness for thought, the tendency of that train of
thought to run into the abstract, and his burning imagination, have
united in producing another quality which strongly marks his style, and
is more pleasing than those last noticed. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's
personification of mental powers, passions.</span> He abounds in
Personification, and delights particularly in personifications of mental
powers, passions, and relations. <span class="sidenote">In <i>Venus and Adonis</i>.</span> This
metaphysico-poetical mood of musing tinges his miscellaneous poems
deeply, especially the Venus and Adonis, which is almost lyrical
throughout; and even in his dramas the style is often like one of
Collins's exquisite odes. <span class="sidenote">Fletcher uses it but little.</span> This
quality is common to him with the narrative poets of his age, from whom
<a name="FNanchor_25:1_51" id="FNanchor_25:1_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_25:1_51" class="fnanchor">[25:1]</a>he received it; but it is adopted to no material extent by any of
his dramatic contemporaries, and by Fletcher less than any. <span class="sidenote">
Shakspere's distinctive use of Personification.</span>The other dramatists,
indeed, are full of metaphysical expressions, of the names of affections
and faculties of the soul; but they do not go on as Shakspeare's
kindling fancy impelled him to do, to look on them as independent and
energetic existences. This figure is one of the most common means by
which he elevates himself into the tragic and poetic sphere, the
compromise between his reason and his imagination, the felicitous mode
by which he reconciles his fondness for abstract thought, with his
allegiance to the genius of poetry. <span class="sidenote">The <i>Two Noble Kinsmen</i>

<p>The hints which you have now perused, are not, I repeat, offered to you
as by any means exhausting the elements of Shakspeare's manner of
writing. They are meant only to bring to your memory such of his
qualities of style as chiefly distinguish him from Fletcher, and are
most prominently present in the play we are examining. <span class="sidenote">In
bits of the <i>Two Noble Kinsmen</i> several of Shakspere's distinctive
qualities are often combin'd.</span> When we shall see those qualities
instanced singly, they will afford a proof of Shakspeare's authorship:
but that proof will receive an incalculable accession of strength when,
as will more frequently happen, we shall have several of them displayed
at once in the same passages. Your recollection of them will serve us as
the lines of a map would in a journey on foot through a wild forest
country: the beauty of the landscape will tempt us not seldom to diverge
and lose sight of our path, and we shall need their guidance for
enabling us to regain it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The story of <i>Palamon and Arcite</i>.</span></p>

<p>The story of <span class="smcap">Palamon and Arcite</span> is a celebrated one, and, besides its
appearance here, has been taken up by other two of our greatest English
poets. Chaucer borrowed the tale from the <i>Teseide</i> of Boccaccio: it
then received a dramatic form in this play; and from Chaucer's antique
sketch it was afterwards decorated with the <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[<a href="./images/27.png">27</a>]</span>trappings of heroic rhyme,
by one who fell on evil days, the lofty and unfortunate Dryden.
<span class="sidenote">Character of the story of Palamon and Arcite.</span> It treats of a
period of ancient and almost fabulous history, which originally belonged
to the classical writers, but had become familiar in the chivalrous
poetry of the middle ages; and retaining the old historical characters,
it intersperses with them new ones wholly imaginary, and, both in the
Knightes Tale and in the play, preserves the rich and anomalous
magnificence of the Gothic cos<a name="FNanchor_27:1_53" id="FNanchor_27:1_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_27:1_53" class="fnanchor">[27:1]</a>tume. <span class="sidenote">Theseus the centre
of <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>.</span> The character round which the others are
grouped, one which Shakspeare has introduced in another of his works, is
the heroic Theseus, whom the romances and chronicles dignify with the
modern title of Duke of Athens; and in this story he is connected with
the tragical war of the Seven against Thebes, one of the grandest
subjects of the ancient Grecian poetry.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">First Act of <i>Two Noble Kinsmen</i> Shakspere's.</span></p>

<p>The whole of the First Act may be safely pronounced to be Shakspeare's.
The play opens with the bridal procession of Theseus and the fair Amazon
Hippolita, whose young sister <span class="smcap">Emilia</span> is the lady of the tale. While the
marriage-song is singing, the train are met by three queens in mourning
attire, who fall down at the feet of Theseus, Hippolita, and Emilia.
They are the widows of three of the princes slain in battle before
Thebes, and the conqueror Creon has refused the remains of the dead
soldiers the last honour of a grave. The prayer of the unfortunate
ladies to Theseus is, that he would raise his powerful arm to force from
the tyrant the unburied corpses, that the ghosts of the dead may be
appeased by the performance of fitting rites of sepulture. The duty
which knighthood imposed on the Prince of Athens, is combated by his
unwillingness to quit his bridal happiness; but generosity and
self-denial at length obtain the victory, and he marches, with banners
displayed, to attack the Thebans.</p>

<p>This scene bears decided marks of Shakspeare.&mdash;The lyrical pieces
scattered through his plays are, whether successful or not, endowed with
a stateliness of rhythm, an originality and clearness of imagery, and a
nervous quaintness and pomp of language, which can scarcely be mistaken.

out after another, in the heat and hurry of imagination: it has both
fulness of illustration, and a variety which is drawn from the most

<p><span class="sidenote">Act I. scene ii.</span></p>

<p>The second scene introduces the heroes of the piece, Palamon and Arcite.
They are two youths of the blood-royal of Thebes, who follow the banners
of their sovereign with a sense that obedience is their duty, but under
a sorrowful conviction that his cause is unjust, and their country
rotten at the core. The scene is a dialogue between them, occupied in
lamentations and repinings over the dissolute manners of their native
Thebes. <span class="sidenote">has the characteristics of Shakspere.</span> Its broken
versification points out Shakspeare; the quaintness of some conceits is
his; and several of the phrases and images have much of his pointedness,
brevity, or obscurity. The scene, though not lofty in tone, does not
want interest, and contains some extremely original illustrations. But
quotations will be multiplied abundantly before we have done; and their
number must not be increased by the admission of any which are not
either unusually good or very distinctly characteristic of their author.
Some lines of the scene have been already given.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Act I. scene iii.</span></p>

<p>The third scene has the farewell commendations of the young Emilia and
her sister to Perithous, when he sets out to join Theseus, then before
the Theban walls, and a subsequent conversation of the two ladies.
<span class="sidenote">is probably all Shakspere's.</span> Much of this scene has

<p>The fourth scene is laid in a battle-field near Thebes, and Theseus

one of those scenes which are introduced into the play in departure from
the narrative of Chaucer, forming an underplot which is clearly the work
of a different artist from many of the leading parts of the drama. The
Noble Kinsmen, cured of their wounds, have been committed to strait and
perpetual prison in Athens, and the first part of this scene is a prose
dialogue between their jailor and a suitor of his daughter. The maiden's
admiration of the prisoners is then exhibited. <span class="sidenote">and is very
dull: it is not Shakspere's.</span> You will see afterwards, that there are
several circumstances besides the essential dulness of this prose part,
which fully absolve Shakspeare from the charge of having written it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The verse of Act II. scene i.</span></p>

<p>The versified portion of this scene, which follows the prose dialogue
among the inferior characters, presents the incident on which the
interest of the story hinges, the commencement of the fatal and
chimerical passion, which, inspiring both the knights towards the young
Emilia, severs the bonds of friendship which had so long held them
together. The noble prisoners are discovered in their turret-chamber,
looking out on the palace-garden, which the lady afterwards enters. They
speak <a name="FNanchor_35:1_67" id="FNanchor_35:1_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_35:1_67" class="fnanchor">[35:1]</a>in a highly animated strain of that <!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[<a href="./images/36.png">36</a>]</span>world from which they
are secluded, and find themes of consolation for the hard lot which had
overtaken them. The dialogue is in many respects admirable. <span class="sidenote">
The verse of Act II. scene i. has the characteristics of Fletcher:</span> <span class="sidenote">double endings,</span>
<span class="sidenote">end-stopt lines,</span> <span class="sidenote">vague images,</span>
It possesses much eloquence of description, and the
character of the language is smooth and flowing; the versification is
good and accurate, frequent in double endings, and usually finishing the
sense with the line; and one or two allusions occur, which, being
favourites of Fletcher's, may be in themselves a strong presumption of
his authorship; the images too have in some instances a want of
distinctness in application or a vagueness of outline, which could be
easily paralleled from Fletcher's acknowledged writings. <span class="sidenote">but
romantic;</span> The style is fuller of allusions than his usually is, but the
images are more correct and better kept from confusion than
Shakspeare's; some of them indeed are exquisite, but rather in the
romantic and exclusively poetical tone of Fletcher, than in the natural
and universal mode of feeling which animates Shakspeare. <span class="sidenote">
slack dialogue.</span>The dialogue too proceeds less energetically than
Shakspeare's, falling occasionally into a style of long-drawn
disquisition which Fletcher often substitutes for the quick and dramatic
conversations of the great poet. <span class="sidenote"><ins class="corr" title="period missing in original">II.</ins> i. one of the finest
scenes that Fletcher ever wrote.</span> On the whole, however, this scene, if
it be Fletcher's, (of which I have no doubt,) is among the very finest
he ever wrote; and there are many passages in which, while he preserves
his own distinctive marks, he has gathered no small portion of the flame
and inspiration of his immortal friend and assistant. In the following
speeches there are images and phrases, which are either identically
Fletcher's, or closely resemble his, and the whole cast both of
versification and idiom is strictly his:&mdash;</p>

<p>But the contentment of the prison is to be interrupted. The fair Emilia
appears beneath, walking in the garden "full of branches green,"
skirting the wall of the tower in which the princes are confined. She
converses with her attendant, and Palamon from the dungeon-grating
beholds her as she gathers the flowers of spring. He ceases to reply to
Arcite, and stands absorbed in silent ecstasy.</p>

tempered, or abstained from treating so sudden and perhaps unnatural an

<p><span class="sidenote">Fletcher has left out Chaucer's making the Knights 'sworn
brethren.'</span></p>

<p>In transferring his story from Chaucer, the poet has here been guilty of
an oversight. The old poet fixes a character of positive guilt on
Arcite's prosecution of his passion, by relating a previous agreement
between the two cousins, by which either, engaging in any adventure
whether of love or war, had an express right to the co-operation of the
other. Hence Arcite's interference with his cousin's claim becomes, with
Chaucer, a direct infringement of a knightly compact; while in the
drama, no deeper blame attaches to it, than as a violation of the more
fragile rules imposed by the generous spirit of friendship.</p>

<p>In the midst of the angry conference, Arcite is called to the Duke to
receive his freedom; and Palamon is placed in stricter confinement, and
removed from the quarter of the tower overlooking the garden.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Act II. scene ii. (Weber, sc. iii. Littledale) is

<p>In the second scene of this act, Arcite, wandering in the
<a name="FNanchor_39:1_72" id="FNanchor_39:1_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_39:1_72" class="fnanchor">[39:1]</a>neighbourhood of Athens, soliloquizes on the decree which had
banished him from the Athenian territory; and, falling in with a band of
country people on their way to games in the city, conceives the <!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[<a href="./images/40.png">40</a>]</span>notion
of joining in the celebration under some poor disguise, in the hope of
finding means to remain within sight of his fancifully beloved mistress.

<p><span class="sidenote">Act III. scene i. is Shakspere's.</span></p>

<p>Nothing in the Third Act can with confidence be attributed to
Shakspeare, except the first scene. This opening scene is laid in the
wood where Palamon has his hiding-place. Arcite enters; and a monologue,
describing his situation and feelings, is, as in Chaucer, overheard by
Palamon, who starts out of the bush in which he had crouched, and shakes
his fettered hands at his false kinsman. <span class="sidenote">Arcite's first
speech has Shakspere's clear images, and familiar dress, nervous
expression, &amp;c.</span> A dialogue of mutual reproach ensues; and Arcite
departs with a promise to return, bringing food for the outcast, and
armour to fit him for maintaining, like a knight, his right to the
lady's love. The commencing speech of Arcite has much of Shakspeare's
clearness of imagery, and of the familiarity of dress which he often
loves to bestow upon allusion; it has also great nerve of expression and
calmness of tone, with at least one play on words which is quite in his
manner, and one (perhaps more) of his identical phrases. The text seems
faulty in one part.</p>

<p>There is great spirit, also, in what follows. Some phrases, here again,
are precisely Shakspeare's; and several parts of the dialogue have much
of his pointed epigrammatic style. The massive accumulation of
reproaches which Palamon hurls on Arcite is, in its energy, more like
him than his assistant; and the opposition of character between Palamon
and his calmer kinsman, is well kept up; but the dialogue cannot be

<p>In the second scene, the only speaker is the jailor's daughter, who,
having lost Palamon in the wood, begins to shew symptoms of unsettled
reason. There is some pathos in several parts of her soliloquy, but
little vigour in the expression, or novelty in the thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Act III. scene iii.</span></p>

<p>The third scene is an exchange of brief speeches between the two
knights. Arcite brings provisions for his kinsman, and the means of
removing his fetters, and departs to fetch the armour. <span class="sidenote">is
probably Fletcher's,</span> <span class="sidenote">and not Shakspere's.</span>
In most respects the scene is not very characteristic of either writer,
but leans towards Fletcher; and one argument for him might be drawn from
an interchange of sarcasms between the kinsmen, in which they retort on
each other, former amorous adventures: such a dialogue is quite like
Fletcher's men of gaiety; and needless degradation of his principal
characters, is a fault of which Shakspeare is not guilty. You may be
able, hereafter, to see more distinctly the force of this reason. The
scene contains one strikingly animated burst of jealous suspicion and
impatience.</p>

<p>In the next two scenes, placed in the forest, the jailor's daughter has
reached the height of frenzy. <span class="sidenote">Gerrold has no spark of

who are now headed by the learned and high-fantastical schoolmaster
Gerrold, a personage who has the pedantry of Shakspeare's Holofernes,
without one solitary spark of his humour. They are preparing a dance for
the presence of the duke, and the maniac is adopted into their number,
to fill up a vacancy. The duke and his train appear,&mdash;the pedagogue
prologuizes,&mdash;the <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[<a href="./images/43.png">43</a>]</span>clowns dance,&mdash;and their self-satisfied Coryphaeus
apologizes and epiloguizes. <span class="sidenote">Act III. scene iv. v.

have been traced in these two scenes.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Act III. scene vi.</span></p>

<p>We have then, in the sixth and last scene of this act, the interrupted
combat of the two princes. <span class="sidenote">Fletcher's, not Shakspere's.</span> The
scene is a spirited and excellent one; but its tone is Fletcher's, not
Shakspeare's. <span class="sidenote">Has not Shakspere's grasp of imagery.</span> The
raillery and retort of the dialogue is more lightly playful than his,
and less antithetical and sententious; and though there are fine images,
they are not seized with the grasp which Shakspeare would have given,
sometimes harsh, but always at least decided. Some of the illustrations
have been quoted (<a href="#Page_17">page 17</a>). The knightly courtesy with which the princes
arm each other is well supported; and their dignity of greeting before
they cross their swords, is fine, exceedingly fine. Nothing can be more
beautifully conceived than the change which comes over the temper of the
generous Palamon, when he stands on the verge of mortal battle with his
enemy. <span class="sidenote">Fletcher's sweet versification and romantic
phraseology.</span> His usual heat and impatience give place to the most
becoming calmness. The versification is very sweet, and the romantic air
of the phraseology is very much Fletcher's, especially towards the end
of the following quotation.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Act III. scene vi.</span></p>

<p>The combat is interrupted by the approach of the Duke and his <!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[<a href="./images/44.png">44</a>]</span>court;
and Palamon, refusing to give back or conceal himself, appears before
Theseus, and declares his own name and situation, and the presumptuous
secret of Arcite. <span class="sidenote">is in Fletcher's style.</span> The scene is good,
but in the flowing style of Fletcher, not the more manly one of
Shakspeare. <span class="sidenote">Death-penalty for the losing knight, a good
addition to Chaucer.</span> The sentence of death, which the duke, in the
first moments of his anger, pronounces on the two princes, is recalled
on the petition of Hippolita and her sister, on condition that the
rivals shall meantime depart, and return within a month, each
accompanied by three knights, to determine in combat the possession of
Emilia; and death by the block is denounced against the knights who
shall be vanquished. Some of these circumstances are slight deviations
from Chaucer; and the laying down of the severe penalty is well
imagined, as an addition to the tragic interest, giving occasion to a
very impressive scene in the last act.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="sidenote">Act IV. all Fletcher's.</span></p>

<p>The Fourth Act may safely be pronounced wholly Fletcher's. <span class="sidenote">
Wants all the leading features of Shakspere's style.</span>All of it, except
one scene, is taken up by the episodical adventures of the jailor's
daughter; and, while much of it is poetical, it wants the force and
originality, and, indeed, all the prominent features of Shakspeare's
manner, either of thought, illustration, or expression. There are
conversations in which are described, pleasingly enough, the madness of
the unfortunate girl, and the finding of her in a sylvan spot, by her
former wooer; but when the maniac herself appears, the tone and subjects
of the dialogue become more objectionable.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Act IV. scene ii.</span></p>

<p>In the second scene of this act, the only one which bears reference to
the main business of the piece, Emilia first muses over the pictures of
her two suitors, and then hears from a messenger, in presence of Theseus
and his attendants, a description, (taken in <a name="FNanchor_44:1_77" id="FNanchor_44:1_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_44:1_77" class="fnanchor">[44:1]</a>its elements from the
Knightes Tale,) of the warriors who were preparing for the field along
with the champion lovers. <span class="sidenote">Emilia's soliloquy on the pictures,
not Shakspere's.</span> In the soliloquy of the lady, while the poetical
spirit is well preserved, the alternations of feeling are given with an
abruptness and a want of insight into the nicer shades of association,
which resemble the extravagant stage effects of the 'King and No King,'
infinitely more than the delicate yet piercing glance with which
Shakspeare looks into the human breast in the 'Othello'; the language,
too, is smoother and less <!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[<a href="./images/45.png">45</a>]</span>powerful than Shakspeare's, and one or two
classical allusions are a little too correct and studied for him.
<span class="sidenote">Act IV. scene ii. Fletcher's.</span> One image occurs, not the
clearest or most chastened, in which Fletcher closely repeats himself:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Act V. is Shakspere's,</span></p>

<p>In the Fifth Act we again feel the presence of the Master of the Spell.
Several passages in this portion are marked by as striking tokens of his
art as anything which we read in 'Macbeth' or 'Coriolanus.' The whole
act, a very long one, may be boldly attributed to him, with the
exception of one episodical scene.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">except scene iv. (Weber: sc. ii. Littledale).</span></p>

<p>The time has arrived for the combat. Three temples are exhibited, as in
Chaucer, in which the rival Knights, and the <a name="FNanchor_45:2_79" id="FNanchor_45:2_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_45:2_79" class="fnanchor">[45:2]</a>Lady of their Vows,
respectively pay their adorations. One principal aim of their
supplications is to learn the result of the coming contest; but the
suspense is kept up by each of the Knights receiving a favourable
response, and Emilia a doubtful one. <span class="sidenote">Act V. sc. ii.<a name="FNanchor_45:3_80" id="FNanchor_45:3_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_45:3_80" class="fnanchor"><span style="font-weight: normal;">[45:3]</span></a> (i.
L.) is lower in key.</span> <span class="sidenote">Act V. sc. i. iii. (Weber: both i.
Littledale) are Shakspere's all through.</span> Three scenes are thus
occupied, the second of which is in somewhat a lower key than the other
two; but even in it there is much beauty; and in the first and third the
tense dignity and pointedness of the language, the gorgeousness and
overflow of illustration, and the reach, the mingled familiarity and
elevation of thought, are admirable, inimitable, and decisive. <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[<a href="./images/46.png">46</a>]</span>From
these exquisite scenes there is a temptation to quote too largely.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Act V. scene i.</span></p>

<p>In the first scene, Theseus ushers the Kinsmen and their Knights into
the Temple of Mars, and leaves them there. After a short and solemn
greeting, the Kinsmen embrace for the last time, Palamon and his friends
retire, and Arcite and his remain and offer up their devotions to the
deity of the place. <span class="sidenote">Spirit and Language Shakspere's.</span> A fine
seriousness of spirit breathes through the whole scene, and the language
is alive with the most magnificent and delicate allusion. In Arcite's
prayer the tone cannot be mistaken. <span class="sidenote">His reflection on Fortune
and strife.</span> The enumeration of the god's attributes is coloured by all
that energetic depth of feeling with which Shakspeare in his historical
dramas so often turns aside to meditate on the changes of human fortune
and the horrors of human enmity.<a name="FNanchor_46:1_81" id="FNanchor_46:1_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_46:1_81" class="fnanchor">[46:1]</a></p>

<p>The fifth scene is the Combat, the arrangement of which is unusual.
Perhaps there is nothing in every respect resembling it in the circle of
the English drama. Theseus and his court cross the stage as proceeding
to the lists; Emilia pauses and refuses to be present; the rest depart,
and she is left. She then, the prize of the struggle, <!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[<a href="./images/50.png">50</a>]</span>the presiding
influence of the day, alone occupies the stage: within, the trumpets are
heard sounding the charge, and the cries of the spectators and tumult of
the encounter reach her ears; one or two messengers recount to her the
various changes of the field, till Arcite's victory ends the fight. The
manner is admirable in which the caution, which rendered it advisable to
avoid introducing the combat on the stage, is reconciled with the pomp
of scenic effect and bustle. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's hand is in it.</span> The
details of the scene, with which alone we have here to do, make it clear
that Shakspeare's hand was in it. The greater part, it is true, is not
of the highest excellence; but the vacillations of Emilia's feelings are
well and delicately given, some individual thoughts and words mark
Shakspeare, there is a little of his obscure brevity, much of his
thoughtfulness legitimately applied, and an instance or two of its
abuse. The strong likeness to him will justify some quotations.</p>

<p>The authorship of the last scene admits of no doubt. The manner is
Shakspeare's, and some parts are little inferior to his very finest
passages. Palamon has been vanquished, and he and his friends are to
undergo execution of the sentence to which the laws of the combat
subjected them. The depth of the interest is now fixed on these
unfortunate knights, and a fine spirit of resigned melancholy inspires
the scene in which they pass to their deaths.<a name="FNanchor_52:2_93" id="FNanchor_52:2_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_52:2_93" class="fnanchor">[52:2]</a></p>

<p>If we were in a situation to give due effect to the supernatural part of
the story, the miserable end of Palamon would affect us with a mingled
sense of pity and indignation. He has been promised success by the
divinity whom he adored, and yet he lies vanquished with the uplifted
axe glittering above his head. Both the drama and Chaucer's poem assume
the existence of such feelings on our part, and hasten to remove the
cause of them. <span class="sidenote"><ins class="corr" title="letter s missing in original">Chaucer's</ins> celestial agency to work out the
plot.</span> A way is devised for reconciling the contending oracles; and the
catastrophe which effects that end, is, in the old poet, anxiously
prepared by celestial agency.<a name="FNanchor_53:4_97" id="FNanchor_53:4_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_53:4_97" class="fnanchor">[53:4]</a> Arcite has got the victory in the
field, as his <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[<a href="./images/54.png">54</a>]</span>warlike divinity had promised him; and an evil spirit is
raised for the purpose of bringing about his death, that the votary of
the Queen of Love may be allowed to enjoy the gentler meed which his
protectress had pledged herself to bestow. These supernal intrigues are,
in the play, no more than hinted at in the way of metaphor.</p>

<p>A cry is heard for delay of the execution; Perithous rushes in, ascends
the scaffold, and, raising Palamon from the block, announces the
approaching death of Arcite, with nearly the same circumstances as in
the poem. While he rode townwards from the lists, on a black steed which
had been the gift of Emily, he had been thrown with violence, and now
lies on the brink of dissolution. <span class="sidenote">Description of Arcite's
mishap is bad, but Shakspere's.</span> The speech which describes Arcite's
misadven<a name="FNanchor_54:1_98" id="FNanchor_54:1_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_54:1_98" class="fnanchor">[54:1]</a>ture has been much noticed by the critics, and by some
lavishly praised. With deference, I think it decidedly bad, but
undeniably the work of Shakspeare. <span class="sidenote">Over-labourd, involvd,
hard, yet Shakspere's, with his words and thoughts.</span> The whole manner of
it is that of some of his long and over-laboured descriptions. It is
full of illustration, infelicitous but not weak; in involvement of
sentence and hardness of phrase no passage in the play comes so close to
him; and there are traceable in one or two instances, not only his
words, but the trains of thought in which he indulges elsewhere,
especially the description of the horse, which closely resembles some
spirited passages in the Venus and Adonis. It is needless to quote any
part of this speech.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">End of the <i>Two Noble Kinsmen</i>.</span></p>

<p>The after-part of this scene, which ends the play, contains some
forcible and lofty reflection, and the language is exceedingly vigorous
and weighty. In Chaucer, the feelings of the dying Arcite are expressed
at much length, and very touchingly; in the play, they are dispatched
shortly, and the attention continued on Palamon, who had been its
previous object:&mdash;</p>

<p>You have now before you an outline of the subject of this highly
poetical drama, with specimens which may convey some notion of the
manner in which the plan is executed. But detached extracts <!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[<a href="./images/56.png">56</a>]</span>cannot
furnish materials for a just decision as to the part which Shakspeare
may have taken even in writing the scenes from which the quotations are
given. If I addressed myself to one previously unacquainted with this
drama, I should be compelled to request an attentive study of it from
beginning to end. <span class="sidenote">Two authors wrote <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>.</span>
Such a perusal would convince the most sceptical mind that two authors
were concerned in the work; it would be perceived that certain scenes
are distinguished by certain prominent characters, while others present
different and dissimilar features. <span class="sidenote">Fletcher was one.</span> If we
are to assume that Fletcher wrote parts of the play, we must admit that
many parts of it were written by another person, and we have only to
inquire who that other was. <span class="sidenote">The other was Shakspere.</span> Without
recurring to any external presump<a name="FNanchor_56:1_100" id="FNanchor_56:1_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_56:1_100" class="fnanchor">[56:1]</a>tions whatever, I think there is
enough in most or all of the parts which are evidently not Fletcher's,
to appropriate them to the great poet whose name, in this instance,
tradition has associated with his. Even in the passages which have been
here selected, you cannot but have traced Shakspeare's hand frequently
and unequivocally. The introductory views which I slightly suggested to
your recollection, may have furnished some rules of judgment, and
cleared away some obstacles from the path; and where I have failed in
bringing out distinctly the real points of difference, your own acute
judgment and delicate taste must have enabled you to draw instinctively
those inferences which I have attempted to reach by systematic
deduction.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fletcher easily distinguisht from Shakspere.</span></p>

<p>In truth, a question of this sort is infinitely more easy of decision
where Fletcher is the author against whose claims Shakspeare's are to be
balanced, than it could be if the poet's supposed assistant were any
other ancient English dramatist. If a drama were presented to us, where,
as in some of Shakspeare's received works, he had taken up the ruder
sketch of an older poet, and exerted his skill in altering and enlarging
it, it would be very difficult indeed to discriminate between the
original and his additions. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's Histories:</span>
<span class="sidenote">their fault.</span> He has often, especially in his earlier works,
and in his histories more particularly, much of that exaggeration of
ideas, and that strained and labouring force of expression, which marked
the Hercules-like infancy of the English Drama. <span class="sidenote">Marlowe.</span>
<span class="sidenote">Marlowe's magnificence like Shakspere sometimes.</span> The
stateliness with which Marlowe paces the <!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[<a href="./images/57.png">57</a>]</span>tragic stage, and the
magnificence of the train of solemn shews which attend him like the
captives in a Roman procession of triumph, bear no distant likeness to
the shape which Shakspeare's genius assumes in its most lofty moods. And
with those also who followed the latter, or trode side by side with him,
he has many points of resemblance or identity. <span class="sidenote">Jonson.</span>
<span class="sidenote">Massinger.</span> <span class="sidenote">Middleton.</span>
Jonson has his seriousness of views, his singleness of purpose, his
weight of style, and his "fulness and frequency of sentence;" Massinger
has his comprehension of thought, giving birth to an involved and
parenthetical mode of construction; and Middleton, if he possesses few
of his other qualities, has much of his precision and straightforward
earnestness of expression.<a name="FNanchor_57:1_101" id="FNanchor_57:1_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_57:1_101" class="fnanchor">[57:1]</a>
In examining isolated passages with the view of ascertaining whether
they were written by Shakspeare or by any of those other <a name="FNanchor_57:2_102" id="FNanchor_57:2_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_57:2_102" class="fnanchor">[57:2]</a>poets, we should
frequently have no ground of decision but the insecure and narrow one of
comparative excellence. <span class="sidenote">Fletcher and Shakspere contrasted.</span>
<span class="sidenote">They differ in <i>kind</i>.</span> When Fletcher is Shakspeare's only competitor, we
are very seldom driven to adopt so doubtful a footing; we are not
compelled to reason from difference in <i>degree</i>, because we are sensible
of a striking dissimilarity in <i>kind</i>. <span class="sidenote">Fletcher.</span>
<span class="sidenote">Shakspere.</span> <span class="sidenote">Fletcher.</span>
<span class="sidenote">Shakspere.</span> <span class="sidenote">Fletcher.</span>
<span class="sidenote">Shakspere.</span> <span class="sidenote">Fletcher.</span>
<span class="sidenote">Shakspere.</span> We observe ease and
elegance of expression opposed to energy and quaintness; brevity is met
by dilation, and the obscurity which results from hurry of conception
has to be compared with the vagueness proceeding from indistinctness of
ideas; lowness, narrowness, and poverty of thought, are contrasted with
elevation, richness, and comprehension: on the one hand is an intellect
barely active enough to seek the true elements of the poetical, and on
the other a mind which, seeing those finer relations at a glance, darts
off in the wantonness of its luxuriant strength to discover qualities
with which poetry is but ill fitted to deal; in the one poet we behold
that comparative feebleness of fancy which willingly stoops to the
correction of taste, and in the other, that warmth, splendour, and
quickness of imagination, which flows on like the burning rivers from a
volcano, quenching all paler lights in its spreading radiance, and
destroying every barrier which would impede or direct its devouring
course. You will remark that certain passages or scenes in this play are
attributed to Shakspeare, not because they are superior to Fletcher's
<!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[<a href="./images/58.png">58</a>]</span>
tone or manner, but because they are unlike it. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's work
unlike Fletcher's.</span> It may be true that most of these possess higher
excellence than Fletcher could have easily reached; but this is merely
an extrinsic circumstance, and it is not upon it that the judgment is
founded. <span class="sidenote">Test between Shakspere and Fletcher.</span> These passages are
recognized as Shakspeare's, not from possessing in a higher degree those
qualities in which Fletcher's merit lies, but from exhibiting other
qualities in which he is partially or wholly wanting, and which even
singly, and still more when combined, constitute a style and manner
opposite to his.</p>

<p>Indeed, since Fletcher is acknowledged to stand immeasurably lower than
Shakspeare, the excellence of some passages might perhaps in itself be
no unfair reason for refusing to the inferior poet the credit of their
execution. But an analysis of the means by which the excellence is
produced places us beyond <a name="FNanchor_58:1_103" id="FNanchor_58:1_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_58:1_103" class="fnanchor">[58:1]</a>the necessity of resorting, in the first
instance at least, to this general ground of decision, which must,
however, be taken into view, when we have been able to assume a position
which entitles us to take advantage of it. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's
external qualities in the <i>Two Noble Kinsmen</i>.</span> <span class="sidenote">Are they
imitations?</span> In many parts of this play we find those external qualities
which form Shakspeare's distinguishing characteristics, not separately
and singly present, but combined most fully and most intimately; and it
is consequently indisputable that we have, either Shakspeare's own
writing, or a faithful and successful imitation of it. <span class="sidenote">
Imitation of Shakspere difficult.</span>It is not easy to perceive with
perfect clearness why it is that imitation of Shakspeare is peculiarly
difficult; but every one is convinced that it is far more so than in the
case of any other poet whatever. <span class="sidenote">Why it is so.</span> The range and
opposition of his qualities, the rarity and loftiness of the most
remarkable of these, and still more, the coincident operation of his
most dissimilar powers, make it next to impossible, even in short and
isolated passages, to produce an imitation which shall be mistaken for
his original composition: but there is not even a possibility of success
in an attempt to carry on such an imitation of him throughout many
entire scenes. <span class="sidenote">Given, his outside dress,</span>
<span class="sidenote">ask whether his spirit is inside it.</span> Where the external qualities of a work
resemble his, the question of his authorship can be determined in no
other way than by inquiring whether the essential elements, and the
spirit which animates the whole, are his also; and that inquiry is not
one for logical argument; it can be answered <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[<a href="./images/59.png">59</a>]</span>only by reflection on the
effect which the work produces on our own minds. <span class="sidenote">The poetic
sense alone can judge.</span> The dullest eye can discriminate the free
motions of the living frame from the convulsed writhings which art may
excite in the senseless corpse; the nightly traveller easily
distinguishes between the red and earthy twinkling of the distant
cottage-lamp, and the cold white gleam of the star which rises beyond
it;&mdash;and with equal quickness and equal certainty the poetical sense can
decide whether the living and ethereal principle of poetry is present,
or only its corporeal clothing, its dead and inert resemblance.
<span class="sidenote">By the emotion it creates, must Shakspere's work be judgd.</span>
The emotion which poetry necessarily awakens in minds qualified as the
subjects of its working, is the only evidence of its presence, and the
measure and index of its strength. If we can read with coldness and
indifference the drama which we are now examining, we must pronounce it
to <a name="FNanchor_59:1_104" id="FNanchor_59:1_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_59:1_104" class="fnanchor">[59:1]</a>be no more than a skilful imitation of Shakspeare; but we must
acknowledge it as an original if the heart burns and the fancy expands
under its influence,&mdash;if we feel that the poetical and dramatic spirit
breathes through all,&mdash;and if the mind bows down involuntarily before
the powers of whose presence it is secretly but convincingly sensible.
<span class="sidenote">And his part of <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i> witnesses for
itself.</span> I cannot have a doubt that the parts of this work which I have
pointed out as Shakspeare's will the more firmly endure this trial, the
more closely and seriously they are revolved and studied.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Shakspere's share of <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>.</span></p>

<p>The portions of the drama which, on such principles as these, have been
set down as Shakspeare's, compose a large part of its bulk, and embrace
most of the material circumstances of the story. <span class="sidenote">Act I.</span>
<span class="sidenote">Act III. sc. i.</span> <span class="sidenote">Act V. except scene iv.</span> They
are,&mdash;the First Act wholly,&mdash;one scene out of six in the Third,&mdash;and the
whole of the Fifth Act, (a very long one,) except one unimportant scene.
These parts are not of equal excellence, but the grounds on which a
decision as to their authorship rests, seem to be almost equally strong
with regard to each.</p>

<p>We have as yet been considering these scenes as so many separate pieces
of poetry; and they are valuable even in that light, not less from their
intrinsic merit than as being the work of our greatest poet. If it be
true merely that Shakspeare has here executed some portions of a plan
which another had previously fixed on and sketched, the drama demands
our zealous study, and is entitled to a place among <!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[<a href="./images/60.png">60</a>]</span>Shakspeare's works.
An examination of separate details cannot enable us to form any more
specific opinion as to the part which he may have taken in its
composition.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="sidenote">Is the design of <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i> Shakspere's?</span></p>

<p>But there is a further inquiry on which we are bound to enter, whatever
its result may be,&mdash;whether it shall allow us to attribute to Shakspeare
a wider influence over the work, or compel us to limit his claim to the
subsidiary authorship, which only we have yet been able to establish for
him. We must now endeavour to trace the design of the work to its
origin; we must look on the parts in their relation to the whole, and
investigate the qualities and character of that whole which the parts
compose. Such an analysis is essential to an appreciation of the real
merit of the drama, and suggests views of far-greater inte<a name="FNanchor_60:1_105" id="FNanchor_60:1_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_60:1_105" class="fnanchor">[60:1]</a>rest
than any which offer themselves in the examination of isolated passages.
And it is likewise necessary as a part of the inquiry which is our
object, not merely because it may tend to strengthen or modify the
decisions which we have already formed, but because it will allow us to
determine other important questions which we have had no opportunity of
treating. <span class="sidenote">Yes, it is.</span> It will justify us, if I mistake not,
in pronouncing with some confidence, that this drama owes to Shakspeare
much more than the composition of a few scenes,&mdash;that he was the poet
who chose the story, and arranged the leading particulars of the method
in which it is handled.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="sidenote">The tragic-comic underplot not Shakspere's.</span></p>

<p>Before we enter the extensive and interesting field of inquiry thus
opened to us, it may be well that I explain the reasons which seem
distinctly to exclude from Shakspeare's part of the work one
considerable portion of it,&mdash;the whole of the tragi-comic under-plot. I
have as yet assigned no ground of rejection, but inferiority in the
execution; but there are other reasons, which, when combined with that,
remove all uncertainty. Slightly as this subordinate story has been
described, enough has been said to point out remarkable imitations of
Shakspeare, both in incident and character. <span class="sidenote">Fletcher's
borrowings in the underplot, from Shakspere.</span> The insane maiden is a
copy of Ophelia, with features from 'Lear'; the comments of the
physician on her sickness of the mind, are borrowed <!-- Page 61 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[<a href="./images/61.png">61</a>]</span>in conception from
'Macbeth'; the character of the fantastic schoolmaster is a repetition
of the pedagogue in 'Love's Labour Lost'; and the exhibition of the
clowns which he directs, resemble scenes both in that play and in the
'Midsummer Night's Dream.' All these circumstances together, or even one
of them by itself, are enough to destroy the notion of Shakspeare's
authorship. The likeness which is found elsewhere to Shakspeare's style,
(and which is far closer in those other parts of the play than it is
here,) is an argument, as I have shewn, in favour of his authorship; the
likeness here in character and incident is even a stronger one against
it. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere doesn't imitate himself in character as he does
in style.</span> In neither of these latter particulars does Shakspeare
imitate himself as he does in style. In some of his earlier plays indeed
we may trace the rude outlines of characters, chiefly comic, which he
was afterwards able to develope with <a name="FNanchor_61:1_106" id="FNanchor_61:1_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_61:1_106" class="fnanchor">[61:1]</a>greater distinctness and more
striking features; but though the likeness, in those cases, were nearer
and more frequent than it is, the transition from the rude block to the
finished sculpture is the allowable and natural progress of genius.
<span class="sidenote">He doesn't reproduce a figure badly.</span> The bare reproduction
of a figure or a scene already drawn with clearness and success, stands
in a very different situation; and, even if it should be nearly equal to
the original in actual merit, it creates a strong presumption of its
being no more than the artifice of an imitator. Where the inferiority of
the execution is palpable, the doubt is raised into certainty.
<span class="sidenote">Shakspere could not have turned his Ophelia into the Jailer's
daughter of <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>.</span> In the case before us, it is
impossible to receive the idea of Shakspeare sitting down in cold blood
to imitate the Ophelia, and to transfer all the tenderness of her
situation to a new drama of a far lower tone, in which also it should
occupy only a subordinate station. He could not have been guilty of
this; he neither needed it, nor would have done it of free will; and,
therefore, I could not have believed it to be his, though the execution
had been far better than it is. <span class="sidenote">This Daughter is an utter
failure.</span> But the inferiority is decided; the imitation produces neither
vigour of style nor depth of feeling; in short, Shakspeare, if he had
made the attempt, could not have failed so utterly. <span class="sidenote">The
Schoolmaster is not Shakspere's.</span> The comic parts are only subservient
to the serious portion of this story; and if Shakspeare did not write
the leading part, he was still less likely to have written the
accessory; but, besides, the imitation is equally unsuccessful; and the
original <!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[<a href="./images/62.png">62</a>]</span>of the schoolmaster is said to have been a personal portrait,
which was very unlikely to have been repeated by the first painter after
the freshness of the jest was gone. I have been the more anxious to
place in its true light the question as to this part of the drama,
because, on its seeming likeness to Shakspeare, Steevens founds an
ingenious hypothesis, by which he endeavours to account for the origin
of the tradition as to Shakspeare's concern in the play. That this is a
designed imitation of Shakspeare is abundantly clear; and it is not
difficult to see why it is an unsuccessful one. <span class="sidenote">Fletcher's
designd imitation of Shakspere.</span> Fletcher possesses much humour, but it
is of a cast very unlike Shakspeare's, and very unfit to harmonise with
it, or to qualify him for the imitation which he has here attempted. Why
he made the attempt, we shall be able to discover only when the freaks
of caprice, and of poetical caprice, <a name="FNanchor_62:1_107" id="FNanchor_62:1_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_62:1_107" class="fnanchor">[62:1]</a>the wildest of all, shall be
fully analyzed and fully accounted for. <span class="sidenote">The underplot not
Shakspere's.</span> All that I have to prove is, that this portion of the work
is not, and could not have been, Shakspeare's.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="sidenote">Shakspere's choice of subjects for his Plays.</span></p>

<p>I have said that I consider as his, both the selection of the plot, and
much of its arrangement. <span class="sidenote">He differs from his chief
contemporaries and successors.</span> As to the Choice of the Subject, my
position is, that in this particular, Shakspeare stands in unequivocal
opposition to Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, and those others,
contemporary with him, or a little his juniors, with whom his name is
generally associated. I can easily shew that this opposition to the
newer school in the choice of stories exists in Shakspeare individually;
and this would be enough for my purpose; but I will go a little farther
than I am called on, because I conceive him to share that opposition
with some other poets, and because views open to us from this
circumstance, which are of some value for the right understanding of his
characteristics. <span class="sidenote">He belongs to the old school.</span> I say then,
that in the choice of subjects particularly, as well as in other
features, Shakspeare belongs to a school older than that of Fletcher,
and radically different from it. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere took old stories;</span>
<span class="sidenote">new poets new ones.</span> The principle of the contrariety in the
choice of subjects between the older and newer schools, is this: the
older poets usually prefer stories with which their audience must have
been previously familiar; the newer poets avoid such known subjects, and
attempt to create an adventitious interest for their pieces, by
appealing <!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[<a href="./images/63.png">63</a>]</span>to the passion of curiosity, and feeding it with novelty of
incident. <span class="sidenote">Early Plays founded on</span> The early writers may have
adopted their rule of choice from a distrust in their own skill: but
they are more likely to have been influenced by reflecting on the
inexperience of their audience in theatrical exhibitions. <span class="sidenote">
History and Tales of Chivalry.</span>By insisting on this quality in their
plots, they hampered themselves much in the choice of them; and the
subjects which offered themselves to the older among them, were mainly
confined to two classes, history and the chivalrous tales, being the
only two cycles of story with which, about the time of Shakspeare's
birth, any general familiarity could be presumed. That such were the
favourite themes of the infant English drama is abundantly clear, even
from the lists of old lost dramas which have been preserved to us.
<span class="sidenote">Classical fables and foreign novels.</span> By the time when
Shakspeare stepped into <a name="FNanchor_63:1_108" id="FNanchor_63:1_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_63:1_108" class="fnanchor">[63:1]</a>the arena, the zeal for translation had
increased the stock of popular knowledge by the addition of the
classical fables and the foreign modern novels; and his immediate
precursors, some of whom were men of much learning, had especially
availed themselves of the former class of plots. <span class="sidenote">Plots of
Shakspere's successors.</span> If, passing over Shakspeare, we glance at the
plots of Fletcher, Jonson, or others of the same period, we find, among
a great diversity of means, a search for novelty universally set on
foot. Jonson is fond of inventing his plots; Beaumont and Fletcher
usually borrow theirs; but neither by the former nor the latter were
stories chosen which were familiar to the people, nor in any instance
perhaps do they condescend to use plots which had been previously
written on. <span class="sidenote">Beaumont <ins class="corr" title="word and missing in original">and</ins> Fletcher's.</span> Where Beaumont and
Fletcher do avail themselves of common tales, they artfully combine them
with others, and receive assistance from complexity of adventure in
keeping their uniform purpose in view. <span class="sidenote">Historical Drama grew
obsolete.</span> The historical drama was regarded by the new school as a rude
and obsolete form; and there are scarcely half a dozen instances in
which any writer of that age, but Shakspeare, adopted it later than
1600. Historical subjects indeed wanted the coveted charm, as did also
the Romantic and the Classical Tales, both of which shared in the
neglect with which the Chronicles were treated. <span class="sidenote">Plots were
got from foreign novels and invention.</span> The Foreign Novels, and stories
partly borrowed from them, or wholly invented, were almost the sole
subjects of the newer drama, which has always the air of addressing
<!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[<a href="./images/64.png">64</a>]</span>itself to hearers possessing greater dramatic experience and more
extended information than those who were in the view of the older
writers.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Shakspere belongs to the older class of dramatists.</span></p>

<p>Shakspeare, in point of time, stood between these two classes: does he
decidedly belong to either, or shew a leaning, and to which? He
unequivocally belongs to the older class; or rather, the opposition to
the newer writers assumes in him a far more decided shape than in any of
his immediate forerunners; for in them are found numerous exceptions to
the rule, in him scarcely one. He returns, in fact, to more than one of
the principles of the old school, which had begun in his time to fall
into disuse. <span class="sidenote">Compare his Histories, narrative chorus long
rymed passages,</span> The external form of some of his plays, particularly
his histories, is quite in the old taste. The narrative chorus is the
most observable remnant of antiquity; and the long rhymed pas<a name="FNanchor_64:1_109" id="FNanchor_64:1_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_64:1_109" class="fnanchor">[64:1]</a>sages
frequent in his earlier works, are abundant in the older writers: Peele
uses them through whole scenes, and Marlowe likewise to excess.
<span class="sidenote">jesters, and choice of known stories.</span> His continual
introduction of those conventional characters, his favourite jesters, is
another point of resemblance to the ruder stage. <span class="sidenote">He's of the
school of Lodge and Greene.</span> And his choice of subjects, when combined
with the peculiarities of economy just noticed, as well as others,
clearly appropriates him to the school of Lodge, Greene, and those elder
writers who have left few works and fewer names. His Historical Plays
are the perfection of the old school, the only valuable specimens of
that class which it has produced, and the latest instance in which its
example was followed; and he has had recourse to the Classical story for
such subjects as approached most nearly to the nature of his English
Chronicles. <span class="sidenote">Of new novel stories,</span> And you must take especial
note, that, even in the class of subjects in which he seems to coincide
with the new school,&mdash;I mean his Plots borrowed from Foreign Novels,&mdash;he
assumes no more of conformity than its appearance, while the principle
of contrariety is still retained. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere chose the most
widely known.</span> The new writers preferred untranslated novels, and, where
they chose translated ones, disguised them till the features of the
original were lost: Shakspeare not only uses translated tales&mdash;(this
indeed from necessity)&mdash;and closely adheres to their minutest
circumstances, but in almost every instance he has made choice of those
among them which can be proved to have been most widely known and
esteemed <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[<a href="./images/65.png">65</a>]</span>at the time. Most of his plots founded on fanciful subjects,
whether derived from novels or other sources, can be shewn to have been
previously familiar to the people. <span class="sidenote">6 Plays of Shakspere
founded on well-known stories.</span> The story of 'Measure for Measure' had
been previously told; that of 'As you Like It', he might have had from
either of two popular collections of tales; the fable of 'Much Ado about
Nothing' seems to have been widely spread, and those of 'All's Well that
Ends Well', and 'The Winter's Tale'; 'Romeo and Juliet' appears in at
least one collection of English novels, and in a poem which enjoyed much
popularity. These are sufficient as examples; but a still more
remarkable circumstance is this. <span class="sidenote">12 on subjects of former
Plays.</span> In repeated instances, about twelve in all, Shakspeare has
chosen subjects on which plays had been previously written; nay more, on
the sub<a name="FNanchor_65:1_110" id="FNanchor_65:1_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_65:1_110" class="fnanchor">[65:1]</a>jects which he has so re-written, he has produced some of
his best dramas, and one his very masterpiece. 'Julius Cæsar' belongs to
this list; '<i>Lear</i>' does so likewise; and '<span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>.' Is not that a
singular fact? I can use it at present only as a most valuable proof
that the view which I take is an accurate one. But Shakspeare has also,
oftener than once, applied to the chivalrous class of subjects, which
was exclusively peculiar to the older school. Its tales indeed bore a
strong likeness to his own most esteemed subjects of study; for, amidst
all their extravagancies and inconsistencies, the Gothic romances and
poems, the older of them at all events, professed in form to be
chronicles of fact, and in principle to assume historical truth as their
groundwork. <span class="sidenote">3 on Classical subjects turned into romances.</span>
'Pericles' is founded on one of the most popular romances of the middle
ages, which had been also versified by Gower, the second father of the
English poetical school. The characters in 'The Midsummer Night's Dream'
are classical, but the costume is strictly Gothic, and shews that it was
through the medium of romance that he drew the knowledge of them; and
the 'Troilus and Cressida' presents another classical and chivalrous
subject, which Chaucer had handled at great length, also invested with
the richness of the romantic garb and decoration.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Shakspere chose the story of the <i>Two Noble Kinsmen</i>.</span></p>

<p>Fletcher and Shakspeare being thus opposed to each other in their choice
of subjects, what qualities are there in the Plot of The Two Noble
Kinsmen, which may appropriate the choice of it to either? In the first
place, it is a chivalrous subject,&mdash;a classical <!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[<a href="./images/66.png">66</a>]</span>story which had already
been told in the Gothic style. <span class="sidenote">Fletcher would neither have
chosen Chaucer's classical story for his plot,</span> The nature of the story
then could have been no recommendation of it to Fletcher. He has not a
single other subject of the sort; he has even written one play in
ridicule of chivalrous observances; and the sarcasm of that humorous
piece<a name="FNanchor_66:1_111" id="FNanchor_66:1_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_66:1_111" class="fnanchor">[66:1]</a>, both in the general design and the particular references,
is aimed solely at the prose romances of knight-errantry, a diseased and
posthumous off-shoot from the parent-root, whose legitimate and ancient
offspring, the metrical chronicles and tales, he seems neither to have
known nor cared for. <span class="sidenote">nor an old story,</span> Secondly, this story
must have been unacceptable to Fletcher, because it was a fa<a name="FNanchor_66:2_112" id="FNanchor_66:2_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_66:2_112" class="fnanchor">[66:2]</a>miliar
one in England. This fact is perhaps sufficiently proved by its being
the subject of that animated and admirable poem of Chaucer, which Dryden
has pronounced little inferior to the Iliad or Æneid; but it is still
more distinctly shewn by a third fact, which completely clenches the
argument against Fletcher's choice of it as a subject. <span class="sidenote">nor
one on which two 16th-century plays had been written.</span> No fewer than two
plays had been written on this story before the end of the sixteenth
century; the earlier of the two, the Palamon and Arcite of Edwards,
acted in 1566, and printed in 1585, and another play called by the same
name, brought on the stage in 1594.<a name="FNanchor_66:3_113" id="FNanchor_66:3_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_66:3_113" class="fnanchor">[66:3]</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Fletcher didn't choose the subject of <i>The Two Noble
Kinsmen</i>.</span></p>

<p>It is thus, I think, proved almost to demonstration, that the person who
chose this subject was not Fletcher; and what has been already said,
even without the specific evidence of individual passages, creates a
strong probability that the choice was made by Shakspeare rather than by
any other dramatic poet of his time. If the question be merely one
between the two writers,&mdash;if, assuming it to be proved that Shakspeare
wrote parts of the play, we have only to ask which of the two it was
that chose the subject,&mdash;we can surely be at no loss to decide.
<span class="sidenote">Shakspere's study of chivalrous poetry.</span> But the presumption
in Shakspeare's favour may be elevated almost into absolute certainty,
while, at the same time, some important qualities of his will be
illustrated,&mdash;if we inquire what was the real extent to which he
attached himself to the study of the chivalrous poetry, from which this
subject is taken, and <!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[<a href="./images/67.png">67</a>]</span>the influence which that study was likely to have
had, and did actually exercise on his writings.</p>

<p>If, being told that a dramatic poet was born in England in the latter
half of the sixteenth century, whose studies, for all effectual benefit
which they could have afforded him, were limited to his own tongue, we
were asked to say what course his acquisitions were likely to have
taken, our reply would be ready and unhesitating. English literature was
of narrow extent before the time in question, and, according to the
invariable progress of mental culture, had been evolved first in those
finer branches which issue primarily from the ima<a name="FNanchor_67:1_114" id="FNanchor_67:1_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_67:1_114" class="fnanchor">[67:1]</a>gination and
affections, and appeal for their effect to the principles in which they
have their source. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere certain to have</span>
<span class="sidenote">first studi'd, and been influenct by, our old narrative poets,</span>Poetry
had reached a vigorous youth, history was in its infancy, philosophy had
not come into being. Had the field of study been wider, it was to poetry
in an especial manner that a poet had to betake himself for an
experience and skill in his art, and in the language which was to be its
instrument. And it was almost solely to the narrative poets that
Shakspeare had to appeal for aid and guidance; for preceding writers in
the dramatic walk could teach him little. They could serve as beacons
only, and not examples, and he had to search in other mines for the
materials to rear his palace of thought. <span class="sidenote">who were of the
Gothic school.</span> But the English poetical writers who preceded him are
all more or less impressed with the seal of the Gothic school, and the
most noted among them belong to it essentially. Chaucer, Lydgate, and
Gower, to more than one of whom Shakspeare is materially indebted, were
the heads of a sect whose subjects and form of composition were varied
only as the various forms and subjects of the foreign romantic writers.
<span class="sidenote">Britain the mother of much fine chivalrous poetry.</span> The
rhymed romance, the metrical vision, the sustained allegorical narrative
or dialogue, were but differing results of the same principle, and forms
too of its original development; for Britain was the mother and nurse of
much of the finest chivalrous poetry, as well as the scene where some of
its most fascinating tales are laid. It is true that English poetry
before the time of Elizabeth presents but few distinguished names; but
there is a world of unappropriated treasures of the chivalrous class of
poetry, which are still the delight of those who possess the key to
their secret chambers, <!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[<a href="./images/68.png">68</a>]</span>and were the archetypes of the earlier poets of
that prolific age. It is important to recollect, that among the poets
who adorn that epoch, the narrative preceded the dramatic. <span class="sidenote">
Spenser belongs to the Gothic school.</span>Spenser belongs, in every view,
to the romantic or Gothic school; the heroic Mort d'Arthur was the rule
of his poetical faith; and it was that school, headed by him, which
Shakspeare, on commencing his course and choosing his path, found in
possession of all the popularity of the day. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere too.</span>
Every thing proves that he allowed himself to be guided by the
prevailing taste. His early poems belong in design to Spenser's school,
and their style is <a name="FNanchor_68:1_115" id="FNanchor_68:1_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_68:1_115" class="fnanchor">[68:1]</a>often imitative of his. In his dramas he has
many points of resemblance to the older chivalrous poets, besides his
occasional adoption of their subjects. His respect for Gower is shewn by
the repeated introduction of his shade as the speaker in his
choruses<a name="FNanchor_68:2_116" id="FNanchor_68:2_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_68:2_116" class="fnanchor">[68:2]</a>; and particular allusions and images, borrowed from
Gothic usages and chivalrous facts, occur at the first blush to the
recollection of every one. But there is a more widely spread influence
than all this. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's mistakes and</span> Many of his most
faulty peculiarities are directly drawn from this source, and his
innumerable misrepresentations or mistakes are not so truly the fruit of
his own ignorance, as the necessary qualities of the class of poets to
which he belonged, shared with him by some of the greatest poetical
names which modern Europe can cite. <span class="sidenote">anomalies, those of his
Gothic school.</span> In this situation are indeed almost all the
irregularities and anomalies which have furnished the unbelievers in the
divinity of his genius with objects of contemptuous abuse;&mdash;his creation
of geographies wholly fictitious,&mdash;his anachronisms in facts and
customs,&mdash;his misstatements of historical detail,&mdash;his dukes and kings
in republics,&mdash;his harbours in the heart of continents, and his journies
over land to remote islands,&mdash;his heathenism in Christian lands and
times, and his bishops, and priests, and masses, <i>in partibus
infidelium</i>. <span class="sidenote">Chaucer and Spenser had the like.</span> We may
censure him for these irregularities if we will; but it is incumbent on
us to recollect that Chaucer and Spenser must bear the same sentence:
and if the faults are considered so weighty as to shut out from our
notice the works in which they are found, the early literature, not of
our own country only, but of the whole of continental Europe, must be
thrown aside as one mass of unworthy fable.</p>

<p><!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[<a href="./images/69.png">69</a>]</span>
In truth, Shakspeare, in throwing himself on a style of thought and a
track of study which exposed him to such errors, did no more than retire
towards those principles which not only were the sources of poetry in
his own country, but are the fountains from which, in every nation, her
first draughts of inspiration are drunk. <span class="sidenote">Poetry is first a
falsifying of History,</span> Poetry in its earlier stages is universally
neither more nor less than a falsifying of history. The decoration of
the Real is an exertion of the fancy which marks an age elder than the
creation of the purely Ideal; it is an effort more successful than the
<a name="FNanchor_69:1_117" id="FNanchor_69:1_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_69:1_117" class="fnanchor">[69:1]</a>attempt which follows it, and the wholly fictitious has always the
appearance of being resorted to from necessity rather than choice.
Cathay is an older and fitter seat of romance than Utopia; and the
historical paladins and soldans are characters more poetical than the
creatures of pure imagination who displaced them. <span class="sidenote">and has
Ignorance as her ally.</span> <span class="sidenote">Her errors depend on the kind of her
small knowledge.</span> But this walk of poetry is one in which she never can
permanently linger; her citadel indeed is real existence partially
comprehended, but she is unable to defend the fortress after knowledge
has begun to sap its outworks; she needs ignorance for her ally while
she occupies the domain of history, and when that companion deserts her,
she unwillingly retreats on the Possible and Invented<a name="FNanchor_69:2_118" id="FNanchor_69:2_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_69:2_118" class="fnanchor">[69:2]</a>, where she
has no enemy to contest her possession of the ground.&mdash;While however she
does continue in her older haunt, she must sometimes wander out of her
imperfectly defined path, and her errors will depend, both in kind and
in amount, on the amount and kind of her knowledge. That the qualities
of poetical literature, in every nation, are dependent on the number and
species of those experiences from which in each particular case the art
receives its materials, is indeed too evident to need illustration; but
some curious inferences are deducible from an application of this truth
to the contrast which is found between the poetical literature of modern
Europe, and that older school which has been called the classical.
<span class="sidenote">And hence come distinctive qualities of the Greek and Modern
school.</span> The inherent excellencies of the ancient Greek poetry may yet
remain to be accounted for from other causes; but this one principle was
adequate to produce the most distinguishing qualities of the pagan
literature, while it is distinctly the very same principle, acting in
different circumstances, which has given birth to the opposite character
of the modern school of invention. <span class="sidenote">Middle-Age</span>
<span class="sidenote">knowledge of vast extent,</span>
<span class="sidenote">but never thorough.</span> During the
period <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[<a href="./images/70.png">70</a>]</span>which witnessed the gradual rise of that anomalous fabric of
poetry, from whose prostrate fragments the perfected literature of
Christian Europe has been erected, knowledge (I am uttering no paradox)
was of vast extent; it embraced many different ages and many distant
regions: but it was also universally imperfect; much was known in part,
but nothing wholly. <span class="sidenote">So it invested History with incongruous
attributes.</span> Hence proceeded the specific difference of that
widely-spread form of poetical invention, namely, the super-abundance
and incongruity of attributes with which <a name="FNanchor_70:1_119" id="FNanchor_70:1_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_70:1_119" class="fnanchor">[70:1]</a>it invested historical
truth; and it is not very difficult to discover why many of those
attributes have never thoroughly amalgamated with the principal mass.
The various sources from which the materials of the romantic poetry were
drawn, present themselves at once to every mind. <span class="sidenote">Early modern
poets invented a national and original literature,</span> By the peculiar
state of their knowledge, and the rude activity of spirit which was its
consequence, the early poets of modern Europe were prepared to invent a
species of literature which should be strictly national in its subjects,
and in its essential parts wholly original. That new branch was exposed,
however, to modifications of various kinds. One temptation to introduce
foreign elements, by which its authors were assailed, was singularly
strong, and can scarcely in any other instance have operated on a
literature arising in circumstances otherwise so favourable to
originality, as those in which they were placed. <span class="sidenote">but, knowing
classics badly,</span> That temptation was offered by the imperfect
acquaintance with the classical authors which formed one part of their
scattered and ill-reconciled knowledge. <span class="sidenote">grafted on their own
works excrescences from classical literature,</span> They were influenced by
this cause, as they could not have failed to be; and the representations
of feelings, habits, and thought, which they borrowed from this source,
being in their nature dissimilar to the constituent parts of the system
to which they were adjected, never could have harmonised with these,
and, under any circumstances, must have always continued to be
excrescences. Other elements of the new system were naturally neither
evil in themselves, nor inconsistent with the principles with which it
was attempted to combine them, but have assumed the aspect of deformity
and incongruity solely from incidental and extraneous causes. <span class="sidenote">
and on History, fictions and mistakes.</span>The fictions and mistakes which
the ignorance of those fathers of our modern poetical learning
superinduced on history ancient and modern, and on every <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[<a href="./images/71.png">71</a>]</span>thing which
related to the then existing state either of the material world or of
human society, were allowable ornaments, so long as knowledge afterwards
acquired did not stamp on them the brand of falsehood; but the moment
that the falsity was exposed, and the charm of possible existence
broken, those adjuncts lost their empire over the imagination, and with
it their appearance of fitness as materials for mental activity.
<span class="sidenote">Supernaturalism of the Romantic Poets</span>
<span class="sidenote">only believable by superstition.</span> In supernatural invention, the early
romantic poets <a name="FNanchor_71:1_120" id="FNanchor_71:1_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_71:1_120" class="fnanchor">[71:1]</a>were still more unfortunate; for when they
endeavoured to colour with imaginary hues the awful outlines of the true
faith, they attempted a conjunction of holiness with impurity, an
identification of the spirit with the flesh, a marriage between the
living and the dead; the purer essence revolted from the union, and the
human mind could acquiesce in imagining it only while it remained bound
in the darkness and fetters of religious corruption. <span class="sidenote">
Characteristics of early Greek poetry.</span>Turn now to the Grecian poetry,
and mark how closely the same principles have operated on it, although
the difference of the circumstances has made the result different.
<span class="sidenote">its tendency to orientalism;</span>The first Grecian inventors were, it is
true, protected in a great measure from the influence of any foreign
literature, simply by the ignorant rudeness of those ages of the world
during which their task was performed; and even here I have no doubt
that an influence not very dissimilar did actually operate; for there
seems to be good reason for supposing that, if we had before us the wild
songs of such bards as the Thracian Orpheus, or the old Musæus, we
should find them strongly marked by that orientalism towards which the
later Greek poetry which remains to us betrays so continual a tendency.
In other respects, the spirit in which the Greeks formed their poetical
system was identical with our own. <span class="sidenote">its falsification of History,</span> Their
elder poets falsified historical facts, invented or disguised historical
characters, and framed erroneous representations of the past in time and
the distant in place, no otherwise than did the romantic fabulists; and
the classical inventors continued to have sufficient faith placed in
their fictions, merely because knowledge advanced too slowly to allow
detection of their falsity so long as the literature of the nation
continued to exist for it as a present possession. <span class="sidenote">its treatment of
Religion.</span> With their religious belief, again, every attractive invention
harmonised, and every splendid addition was readily incorporated
<!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[<a href="./images/72.png">72</a>]</span>as a consistent part; where all was false, a falsity
the more was unperceived or uncensured, and where sublimity and beauty
were almost the only objects sought, they were gladly accepted from
whatever quarter or in whatever shape they came.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Shakspere, for his stories and form, left his own time, and
delighted in the past.</span></p>

<p>So far as these considerations seem to elucidate the principles on which
Shakspeare proceeded, they do so by exhibiting him as withdrawing from
his own times as to his subjects and the ex<a name="FNanchor_72:1_121" id="FNanchor_72:1_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_72:1_121" class="fnanchor">[72:1]</a>ternal form of his
works, though not as to their animating spirit,&mdash;as placing himself
delightedly amidst the rude greatness of older poetry and past ages, and
viewing life and nature from their covert, as if he had sat within a
solitary and ruined aboriginal temple, and looked out upon the valley
and the mountains from among those broken and massive columns, whose
aspect gave majesty and solemnity to the landscape which was beheld
through their moss-grown vistas. <span class="sidenote">Thence his faults.</span> So far
as these views have any force as a defence of faults detected in the
great poet, that defence is founded on the consideration that the errors
were unavoidable consequences of the system which produced so much that
was admirable, and that they were shared with him by those whom he
followed in his selection of subjects and form of writing. So far as all
that has been said on this head has a close application to the main
subject of our inquiry, its sum is briefly this. <span class="sidenote">Summary of
reasons why Shakspere chose the plot of <i>Two Noble Kinsmen</i>.</span>
<span class="sidenote">He went back to the school of</span>
<span class="sidenote">Chaucer</span> <span class="sidenote">and
Spenser;</span> <span class="sidenote">which Milton, after, sought.</span>
<span class="sidenote">Shakspere's love of old poems.</span>An argument arises in favour of
Shakspeare's choice of the plot of this drama, from its general
qualities, as a familiar and favourite story, and one of a class which
had been frequently used by the older dramatists; that argument receives
additional strength from the fact of this individual subject having been
previously treated in a dramatic form; and it is rendered almost
impregnable when we consider the subject particularly as a chivalrous
story, and as belonging and leading us back to that native school to
which Shakspeare, though in certain respects infected by the exotic
taste of the age, yet in essentials belonged,&mdash;the wilderness in which
Chaucer had opened up the well-head of poetry, where Gower and Lydgate
had drunk freely, and Sackville had more sparingly dipped his brow,&mdash;the
paradise through which Spenser had joyfully wandered with the heavenly
Una,&mdash;the patriarchal forest into which afterwards Milton loved to
retire from his lamp-lighted chamber, to <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[<a href="./images/73.png">73</a>]</span>sleep at the foot of some huge
over-hanging oak, and dream of mailed knights riding by his
resting-place, or fairy choirs dancing on the green hillocks
around,&mdash;the enchanted rose garden where Shakspeare himself gathered
those garlands of beauty, which he has described as adding glory even to
his thoughts of love.</p>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Sonnet 106.</i></p>

<p>In the Arrangement of the Plot also there are circumstances which point
emphatically to Shakspeare's agency. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere seen in the
simplicity of the plot.</span> One strong argument is furnished by a very
prominent quality of the plot as it is managed,&mdash;its simplicity.
<span class="sidenote">He relied on the execution of the parts, not the complication
of the whole.</span> This quality is like him, as being in this case the
result of a close adherence to the original story; but it is also like
him in itself, since the arrangement of all his works indicates the
operation of a principle tending to produce it, namely, a reliance for
dramatic effect on the execution of the parts rather than on the
mechanical perfection or complication of the whole. His contemporaries,
in their own several ways, bestowed extreme care on their plots.
<span class="sidenote">Beaumont and Fletcher's plots depend more on surprise and
incident.</span> With Beaumont and Fletcher, hurry, surprise, and rapid and
romantic revolution of incident are the main object, rather than tragic
strength or even stage effect: their plays would furnish materials for
extended novels, and are often borrowed from such without concentration
or omission. Shakspeare's comparative poverty of plot is not approached
by them even in their serious plays, and the lively stir of their comic
adventures is the farthest from it imaginable. <span class="sidenote">B. Jonson's
plots admirably constructed.</span> Jonson's plots are constructed most
elaborately and admirably: one or two of them are without equal for
skill of conduct and pertinency and connection of parts. This cautious
and industrious poet never confided in his own capability of making up
for feebleness of plan by the force of individual passages; and his
distrust was well judged, for the abstract coldness of his mind <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[<a href="./images/74.png">74</a>]</span>betrays
itself in every page of his dialogue, and his scenes need all their
beauty of outline to conceal the frigidity of their filling up. Ford and
Massinger agree much in their choice of plots, both preferring incidents
of a powerfully tragic nature: but their modes of management are widely
different. <span class="sidenote">Ford's gloomy plots softened by tenderness</span>
<span class="sidenote">and regret.</span> Ford, on the gloom of whose stories glimpses
<a name="FNanchor_74:1_123" id="FNanchor_74:1_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_74:1_123" class="fnanchor">[74:1]</a>of pathos fall like moonlight, delights, when he comes to work up
the details of his tragic plan, in softening it down into the most
dissolving tenderness; at his bidding tears flow in situations where we
listen rather to hear Agony shriek, or look to behold Terror freezing
into stone; his emotion is not the rising vehemence of present passion,
but the anguish, subsiding into regret, which lingers when suffering is
past, and suggests ideas of eventual resignation and repose;&mdash;his verse
is like the voice of a child weeping itself to sleep. <span class="sidenote">
Massinger's stage effect by situations,</span> <span class="sidenote">and tragic design.</span>
<span class="sidenote">His coldness of expression.</span> Massinger crowds adventure upon
adventure, and his situations are wound up to the height of unmixed
horror; for stage effect and tragic intensity, some of them, as for
example the last scene in 'The Unnatural Combat', and the celebrated one
in 'The Duke of Milan', are unequalled in the modern drama, and worthy
of the sternness of the antique; but it is in the design alone that the
tragic spirit works; the colouring of the details is cold as monumental
marble; the pomp of lofty eloquence apes the simplicity of grief, or
silence is left to interpret alike for sorrow or despair. To the
carefulness in outlining the plan and devising situations, thus shewn in
different ways, Shakspeare's manner is perfectly alien. <span class="sidenote">
Shakspere's great aim to bring out character and feeling.</span>He never
exhausts himself in framing his plots, but reserves his strength for the
great aim which he had before him, the evolution of human character and
passion, a result which he relied on his own power to produce from any
plot however naked. He does not want variety of adventure in many of his
plays; but he has it only where his novel or chronicle gave it to him:
he does not reject it when it is offered, but does not make the smallest
exertion to search for it. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's plays with no plot:</span>
Some of his plays, especially his comedies, have actually no plot, and
those, too, the very dramas in which his genius has gained some of its
most mighty victories. <span class="sidenote"><i>The Tempest.</i></span> 'The Tempest' is an
instance: what is there in it? A ship's company are driven by wreck upon
an island; they find an old man there who had been injured by certain of
them, <!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[<a href="./images/75.png">75</a>]</span>
and a reconciliation takes place. <span class="sidenote"><i>As You Like It.</i></span>
The only action of 'As You Like It' is pedestrian; if the characters had
been placed in the forest in the first scene, the drama would have been
then as ripe for its catastrophe as it is in the last. <span class="sidenote">
<i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i> has no plot.</span>'The Midsummer Night's Dream'
relates a midnight stroll in a wood; and the unreal na<a name="FNanchor_75:1_124" id="FNanchor_75:1_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_75:1_124" class="fnanchor">[75:1]</a>ture of the
incidents is playfully indicated in its name. It is from no stronger
materials than those three frail threads of narrative that our poet has
spun unrivalled tissues of novel thought and divine fancy. And, as in
his lighter works he is careless of variety of adventure, so in his
tragic plays he does not seek to heap horrors or griefs one upon another
in devising the arrangement of his plots. <span class="sidenote">In the plots of
Shakspere's Tragedies, details and character are the main things.</span> In
this latter class of his works, the skill and force with which the
interest is woven out of the details of story and elements of character,
make it difficult for us to see how far it is that we are indebted to
these for the power which the scene exerts over us. But with a little
reflection we are able to discover, that there is scarcely one drama of
his, in which, from the same materials, situations could not have been
formed, which should have possessed in their mere outline a tenfold
amount of interest and tragic effect to those which Shakspeare has
presented to us. <span class="sidenote">He could have made more striking effect out
of <i>Hamlet</i>, Acts IV. &amp; V. 4.</span> 'Hamlet' offers, especially in the two
last acts, some remarkable proofs of his indifference to the means which
he held in his hands for increasing the tragic interest of his
situations, and of the boldness with which he threw himself on his own
resources for the creation of the most intense effect out of the
slenderest outline. <span class="sidenote"><i>Othello</i>, Act III.</span> But no example can
shew more strikingly his independence of tragic situation, and his power
of concocting dramatic power out of the most meagre elements of story,
than the third act of the Othello. It contains no more than the
development and triumph of the devilish design which was afterwards to
issue in murder and remorse; and other writers would have treated it in
no other style than as necessary to prepare the way for the harrowing
conclusion. In the Moor's dialogues with Iago, the act of vengeance,
ever and anon sternly contemplated, and darkening all with its horror,
is yet but one ingredient in the misery of the tale. <span class="sidenote">So in
the end of <i>Lear</i>,</span> These scenes are a tragedy in themselves, the story
of the most hideous revolution in a noble nature; and their catastrophe
of wretchedness is complete when <!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[<a href="./images/76.png">76</a>]</span>the tumult of doubt sinks into
resolved and desolate conviction,&mdash;when the Moor dashes Desdemona from
him, and rushes out in uncontrollable agony.&mdash;Read also the conclusion
of Lear, and learn the same lesson from the economy of that most
touching scene. <span class="sidenote">all is left clear for the one group, the
father and his dead child.</span> The horrors which have gathered so thickly
<a name="FNanchor_76:1_125" id="FNanchor_76:1_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_76:1_125" class="fnanchor">[76:1]</a>throughout the last act, are carefully removed to the background,
and free room is left for the sorrowful groupe on which every eye is
turned. The situation is simple in the extreme; but how tragically
moving are the internal convulsions for the representation of which the
poet has worthily husbanded his force! Lear enters with frantic cries,
bearing the body of his dead daughter in his arms; he alternates between
agitating doubts and wishing unbelief of her death, and piteously
experiments on the lifeless corpse; he bends over her with the dotage of
an old man's affection, and calls to mind the soft lowness of her voice,
till he fancies he can hear its murmurs. Then succeeds the dreadful
torpor of despairing insanity, during which he receives the most cruel
tidings with apathy, or replies to them with wild incoherence; and the
heart flows forth at the close with its last burst of love, only to
break in the vehemence of its emotion,&mdash;commencing with the tenderness
of regret, swelling into choking grief, and at last, when the eye

<p>The application here of the differences thus pointed out is easy enough.
Fletcher either would not have chosen so bare a story, or he would have
treated it in another guise. <span class="sidenote">Incidents of <i>The Two Noble

many nor highly wrought: they are only the capture of the two

decide their title to her,&mdash;and the death of Arcite after it. And no
complexity of minor adventures is inserted to disturb the simplicity so
presented. <span class="sidenote">wouldn't have suited Fletcher.</span> In all this there
is nothing which Fletcher could have found sufficient to maintain <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[<a href="./images/77.png">77</a>]</span>that

foreground, and more constantly into action: the one simple and
inartificial story which we have, possessing none of his mercurial
activity of motion, and scarcely exciting a feeling of curiosity, would
have been transformed into a complication of intrigues, amidst which the
figures who occupy the centre of the piece as it stands, would have been
only individuals sharing their importance with others, and scarcely
allowed room enough to make their features at all distinguishable.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Shakspere's handling seen in certain scenes of <i>The Two Noble
Kinsmen</i>.</span></p>

<p>In the management of particular scenes of this play, likewise, certain
circumstances are observable, which, separately, seem to go a certain
length in establishing Shakspeare's claim to the arrangement, and have
considerable force when taken together. <span class="sidenote">Act I. scene ii.
design'd by Shakspere.</span> The second scene of the first act would appear
to have been sketched by him rather than Fletcher, from its containing
no activity of incident, and serving no obvious purpose but the
development of the character and situation of the two princes; a mode of
preparation not at all practised by Fletcher. <span class="sidenote">Act I. scene
iii. also. And</span> Neither does any consequence flow from the beautiful
scene immediately following; a circumstance which points out Shakspeare
as having arranged the scene, and would strengthen the evidence of his
having written the dialogue, if that required any corroboration.
<span class="sidenote">Act V. scenes i. ii. iii. [? Emilia with the pictures.]</span> The
bareness and undiversified iteration of situation in the first three
scenes of the last act form one presumption against the devising of
those scenes by Fletcher. <span class="sidenote">Act V. scene v. also designd by
Shakspere.</span> The economy of the fifth scene of that act, in which Emilia,
left alone on the stage, listens to the noise of the combat, is also, to
me, strongly indicative of Shakspeare. The contrivance is unusual, but
extremely well imagined. I do not recollect an instance in Fletcher
bearing the smallest likeness to it, or founded on any principles at all
analogous to that which is here called into operation. In Shakspeare, I
think we may, in more than one drama, discover something which might
have given the germ of it. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's expedients for
avoiding spectacles; in</span> He has not only in his historical plays again
and again regretted the insufficiency of the means possessed by his
stage, or any other, for the representation of such <!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>[<a href="./images/78.png">78</a>]</span>spectacles; but in
several of those plays he has devised expedients for avoiding them. In
'Henry V.' we have the battle of Azincour; but the only encounter of
<a name="FNanchor_78:1_127" id="FNanchor_78:1_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_78:1_127" class="fnanchor">[78:1]</a>the opposite parties is that of Pistol and the luckless Signor
Dew. <span class="sidenote"><i>1 Henry IV.</i>,</span> In 'the first part of Henry IV.' he has
shewn an unwillingness to risk the effect even of a single combat; for
in the last scene of that play, where prince Henry engages Hotspur, the
spectator's attention is distracted from the fight between them, by the
entrance of Douglas, and his attack on the prudent Falstaff. <span class="sidenote">
<i>Richard II.</i>,</span>In 'Richard II.' the lists are exhibited for the duel of
Bolingbroke and Norfolk, which is inartificially broken off at the very
last instant by the mandate of the king. <span class="sidenote">Emilia in <i>Two N.
K.</i> I. v., like Lady Macbeth in II. ii. of <i>Macbeth</i>.</span> But a more deeply
marked likeness to the spirit in which the scene in 'The Two Noble
Kinsmen' is arranged, meets us in Lady Macbeth watching and listening
while her husband perpetrates the murder, like a bad angel which delays
its flight only till it be assured that the whispered temptation has
done its work. And in this combat scene, even the ancient and artless
expedient used, of relating important events by messengers brought in
for that sole end, and having no part in the action, may be noticed as
belonging to an older form of the drama than Fletcher's, and as being
very frequently practised by Shakspeare himself.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="sidenote">The motives of the play of <i>The Two N. K.</i></span></p>

<p>In quitting our cursory examination of the qualities which distinguish
the mechanical arrangement of the play, we may advert to the mode in
which those influences are conceived which give motion to the incidents
of the story, and regulate its progress. <span class="sidenote">Dramatic art
defin'd.</span> The dramatic art is a representation of human character in
action; and action in human life is prompted by passion, which the other
powers of the mind serve only to guide, to modify, or to quell. In the
conception of the passions which are chiefly operative in this drama,
there seems to be much that is characteristic of a greater poet than
Fletcher. <span class="sidenote">In <i>The Two N. K.</i> the moving passions are Love and
Jealousy.</span> In the first place, the passions which primarily originate
the action of the piece are simple; they are Love and Jealousy; the
purest and most disinterested form of the one, and the noblest and most
generous which could be chosen for the other. <span class="sidenote">This conception
is Shakspere's.</span> The conception is Shakspeare's in its loftiness and
magnanimity; and it is his <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[<a href="./images/79.png">79</a>]</span>also as being a direct appeal to common
sympathies, modified but slightly by partial or fugitive views of
nature. <span class="sidenote">The keeping close to the leading motives, is
Shakspere's doing.</span> But it also resembles him in the singleness and
coherence of design with <a name="FNanchor_79:1_128" id="FNanchor_79:1_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_79:1_128" class="fnanchor">[79:1]</a>which the idea is seized and followed
out. It cannot be necessary that I should specifically exemplify the
closeness with which those ruling passions are brought to bear on the
leading circumstances of the story from first to last. And it is almost
equally superfluous to remind you, how far any such adherence to that
unity of impulse, operates as evidence in a question between the two
poets whom we have here to compare. <span class="sidenote">Fletcher's inability to
work a character out, to keep one passion always in the front.</span>
Fletcher, in common with other poets of all ranks inferior to the
highest, is unable to preserve any one form of passion or of character
skilfully in the foreground: he may seem occasionally to have proposed
to himself the prosecution of such an end, but he either degenerates
into the exhibition of a few over-wrought dramatic contrasts, or loses
his way altogether amidst the complicated adventures with which he
incumbers his stories. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's definite purpose and
keeping to it.</span> This inability to keep sight of an uniform design, is in
truth one striking argument of inferiority; and the clearness with which
Shakspeare conceives a definite purpose, and the fixedness with which he
pursues it, go very far to unravel the great secret of his power.
<span class="sidenote">His relying on the emotion he puts into his characters.</span> I
have already pointed out to you, perhaps without necessity, wherein it
is that his strength of passion consists; that it is not in the
incidents of his fable, but in his mode of treating the incidents; that
he will not rely on mere vigour or skill of outline in his
stage-grouping, for that influence which he is conscious of being always
able to acquire more worthily, by the beauty and emotion which he
breathes into the organic formation of the living statuary of the scene;
that he refuses to sacrifice to the meretricious attraction of strained
situations or entangled incidents, the internal and self-supporting
strength of his historical pictures of the heart, or the unflinching
accuracy of his demonstrations of the intellectual anatomy. <span class="sidenote">
Shakspere's unity of purpose, seen in his conception, and his carrying
this out.</span>In a similar way you will look for his unity of purpose, not
in the mechanical economy of his plots, but in the elementary conception
of his characters, and in his developement of the principles of passion
under whose suggestions those characters act. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's
conception of character, and method of developing it.</span> He chooses as the
subject of his delineation some mightily and truly conceived
impersonation of human attributes, <!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[<a href="./images/80.png">80</a>]</span>inconsistent it may be in itself,
but faithful to its prototype as being inconsistent according to the
rules which guide inconsistency in our enigmati<a name="FNanchor_80:1_129" id="FNanchor_80:1_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_80:1_129" class="fnanchor">[80:1]</a>cal mental
constitution; for the exhibition of the character so imagined he devises
some chain of events by which its internal springs of action may be
brought into play; and he traces the motion and results of those
spiritual impulses with an undeviating steadiness of design, which turns
aside neither to raise curiosity nor to gratify a craving for any other
mean excitement. Some singular instances of Shakspeare's fine judgment
in clinging to one great design, are furnished by the 'Othello.'
<span class="sidenote">Desdemona's murder compard with Annabella's (by Ford).</span> The
death of Desdemona has been compared with the murder of Annabella, a
scene (evidently drawn from it) in a drama of Ford's on a story which
makes the flesh creep. <span class="sidenote">Ford's above Shakspere's in pathos.</span>
Some have pronounced Ford's scene superior in pathos to Shakspeare's: I
think it is decidedly so. The tender mournfulness of the language and
few images is exquisite, and the sweet sad monotonous melody of the
versification is indescribably affecting. Is it from weakness that
Shakspeare has not given to the death of his gentle lady an equally
strong impress of pathos? No. He was not indeed susceptible of the
feminine abandonment of Ford; but he was equal to a manly tone of
feeling, fitted to excite a truer sympathy. <span class="sidenote">Why? Because of
Shakspere's self-restraint.</span> He has refused to stretch the chords of
feeling to the utmost in favour of Desdemona; and his refusal has a
design and meaning in it. <span class="sidenote">The mind of Othello is the centre
of Shakspere's play,</span> There is anguish in the scene, and the most utter
yielding to overpowering sorrow; but it is the Moor who feels those
emotions, and it is the exhibition of his mind which is the leading end
of this scene, as of the rest of the drama. <span class="sidenote">and the pathos of
Desdemona's death must be kept down.</span> The suffering lady is but an
inferior actor in the scene; her situation is brought out with perfect
skill and genuine tenderness, so far as it is consistent with the first
object and illustrative of it; but its expression is arrested at the
point where its further developement would have marred the effect of the
scene as a whole, and broken in on its pervading spirit. Ford had no
such aim in view; and the very scene of his which is so beautiful in
itself, loses almost all its force when regarded as a part of the play
in which it is inserted.</p>

<p>These principles of Shakspeare's could be traced as influencing the
drama of the 'Two Noble Kinsmen,' even if there were nothing <!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[<a href="./images/81.png">81</a>]</span>farther to
shew their effect than what has been already <a name="FNanchor_81:1_130" id="FNanchor_81:1_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_81:1_130" class="fnanchor">[81:1]</a>noticed. But their
power is displayed still more admirably in a second quality in the mode
of conception, less open to notice, but breathing actively through all.
There is skill in the mental machinery which gives motion to the story;
but there is even greater art in the application of a hidden influence,
which controls the action of the moving power, and equalizes its
effects. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's art in subduing all <i>The Two Noble
Kinsmen</i> to one Friendship.</span> That secret principle is Friendship, the
operation of which is shewn most distinctly in the Kinsmen, guiding
every part of their behaviour except where their mutual claim to
Emilia's love comes into operation, never extinct even there, though its
effect be sometimes suspended, and awakening on the approach of Arcite's
death, with a warmth which is natural as well as touching. <span class="sidenote">
Love of Friends the leading idea of <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>.</span>But this
feeling has a farther working: Love of Friends is in truth the leading
idea of the piece: the whole drama is one sacrifice on the altar of one
of the holiest influences which affect the mind of man. Palamon and
Arcite are the first who bow down before the shrine, but Theseus and
Perithous follow, and Emilia and her sister do homage likewise.
<span class="sidenote">The harmony of its parts, an idea beyond Fletcher.</span> This
singular harmony of parts was an idea perfectly beyond Fletcher's reach;
and the execution of it was equally unfit for his attempting. The
discrimination, the delicate relief, with which the different shades of
the affection are elaborated, is inimitable. The love of the Princesses
does not issue in action; it is a placid feeling, which gladly
contemplates its own likeness in others, or turns back with memory to
the vanished hours of childhood: with Theseus and his friend, the
passion is exhibited dimly, as longing for exertion, but not gifted with
opportunity; and in the Kinsmen, it bursts out into full activity,
quelling all but the one omnipotent passion, and tempering and purifying
even it. With this exception, you will not look for much of Shakspeare's
skill in delineating character. <span class="sidenote">Not much of Shakspere's
characterization in <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>.</span> The features of the two
Princes are aptly enough distinguished; but neither in them, nor in any
of the others, is there an approach to his higher efforts. You will
recollect that in his acknowledged works those finer and deeper pryings
into character have place only in few instances; and that the greater
number of his dramas depend for their effect chiefly on other causes,
some of which are energetic in this very play.</p>

<p><!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[<a href="./images/82.png">82</a>]</span>
<a name="FNanchor_82:1_131" id="FNanchor_82:1_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_82:1_131" class="fnanchor">[82:1]</a>While you successively inspected particular passages in this
play, your attention was necessarily called both to the character of its
imaginative portions, and to the tone of reflection which is so
frequently assumed in it. <span class="sidenote">Whose is the ruling temper of <i>The
Two Noble Kinsmen</i>?</span> The drama having been now put entirely before you,
I shall wish you to ponder its ruling temper as a whole, and to
determine whether that temper is Fletcher's, or belongs to a more
thoughtful, inquisitive, and solemn mind. <span class="sidenote">Seek in it the mind
of its author.</span> When you institute such a reconsideration, I shall be
desirous that you contemplate the internal spirit of the work from a
loftier and more commanding station than that which you formerly
occupied; and I shall crave you to view its elements of thought and
feeling less as the qualities of a literary work, than as the signs and
results of the mental constitution of its author. <span class="sidenote">The duty of
our reverence for Shakspere, the Star of Poets, being intelligent.</span> I
cannot regard as altogether foreign to our leading purpose any inquiry
which may hold out the promise of illustrating the characteristics of
Shakspeare even slightly, and of teaching us to mingle a more active
discernment in the reverence with which we look up to the Star of Poets
from the common level of our unendowed humanity. You will therefore have
the patience to accompany me in the suggestion of some queries as to the
character of his mode of thinking, and the way in which his reflective
spirit and his poetical qualities of mind are combined and influence
each other. We may be able to perceive the more distinctly the real
character both of his intellect and his poetical faculty, if you will
consent that our investigation shall set out from a point which you may
be inclined to consider somewhat more remote than is altogether
necessary. <span class="sidenote">We'll treat 1. the true functions of Poetry, 2.
its true province.</span> It is to be desired that we should have clearly in
our view, first, the true functions of the poetical faculty, and,
secondly, the province in poetical invention which legitimately belongs
to the imagination, properly so called. Sound conclusions on both these
points are indispensable to sound criticism on individual specimens of
the poetical art; and when we attempt to reason on particular cases,
without having those conclusions placed prominently in view at the
outset, the vagueness of ordinary language makes us constantly liable to
lose sight of their true grounds and distinctions. The laying down of
such principles at the institution of an inquiry into the poetical
character of a great <a name="FNanchor_82:2_132" id="FNanchor_82:2_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_82:2_132" class="fnanchor">[82:2]</a>poet, is therefore in no degree less useful,
than the inculcating of familiar truths is in the instructions <!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[<a href="./images/83.png">83</a>]</span>of
religious and moral teachers; the end in each of the cases being, not
the establishing of new principles, but the placing of known and
admitted ones in an aspect which shall render them influential; and the
necessity in each, arising from the danger which exists lest the
principles, acknowledged in the abstract, should in practice be wholly
disregarded.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Contrast of the Arts of Poetry and Design, in Lessing's
<i>Laocoon</i>.</span></p>

<p>We can in no way discover the real character and objects of the Poetical
Art so easily as by contrasting it with the Arts of Design; and the
materials for such a comparison are afforded by the Laocoon of Lessing.
<span class="sidenote">The Greeks subordinated Expression to Beauty.</span> The principles
established in that admirable essay will scarcely be now disputed, and
may be fairly enough summed up in the following manner.<a name="FNanchor_83:1_133" id="FNanchor_83:1_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_83:1_133" class="fnanchor">[83:1]</a>&mdash;A study
of the Grecian works of art convinces us, that "among the ancients
Beauty was the presiding law of those arts which are occupied with
Form;" that, to that supreme object, the Greek artists sacrificed every
collateral end which might be inconsistent with it; and that, in
particular, they expressed the external signs of mental commotion and
bodily suffering, to no farther extent than that which allowed Beauty to
be completely preserved. <span class="sidenote">And all Design must do the same,
because</span> Now, that this subordination of Expression to Beauty is a
fundamental principle of art, and not a mere accidental quality of
Grecian art individually, is proved by considering the peculiar
constitution and mechanical necessities of art. Its representations are
confined to a single instant of time; and that one circumstance imposes
on it two limitations, which necessarily produce the characteristic
quality of the Grecian works. <span class="sidenote">1. the expression must be
caught before the highest passion is attaind;</span> First, "the expression
must never be selected from what may be called the <i>acme</i> or
transcendent point of the action;" and that because, the power of the
arts of design being confined to the arresting of a single point in the
developement of an action, it is indispensable that they should select a
point which is in the highest degree significant, and most fully excites
the imagination; a condition <a name="FNanchor_83:2_134" id="FNanchor_83:2_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_83:2_134" class="fnanchor">[83:2]</a>which is fulfilled only by those
points in an action in which the action moves onward, and the passion
which prompts it increases; and which is not fulfilled in any degree by
the highest <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[<a href="./images/84.png">84</a>]</span>stage of the passion and the completion of the action.
<span class="sidenote">2. because the expression must not be that of a momentary
feeling.</span> <span class="sidenote">But Poetry is not bound by the limits of the Fine
Arts.</span> <span class="sidenote">It can seize passion at its height.</span> Secondly, a
limitation is imposed as to the choice of the proper point in the onward
progress of the action: for art invests with a motionless and unchanging
permanence the point of action which it selects; and consequently any
appearance which essentially possesses the character of suddenness and
evanescence is unfit to be its subject, since the mind cannot readily
conceive such transitory appearances as stiffened into that monumental
stability.&mdash;Since it is by the limitation of the Fine Arts to the
representation of a single instant of time that the two limitations in
point of expression are imposed, and since Poetry is not subject to that
mechanical limitation, but can describe successively every stage of an
action, and every phasis of a passion, it follows that this latter art
is not fettered by the limitation in expression, which is consequent on
the physical limitation of the other; and hence the exhibition of
passion in its height is as allowable in poetry as it is inadmissible in
the arts of design. <span class="sidenote">Beauty is but one of its many resources.</span>
And since the whole range and the whole strength of human thought,
action, and passion, are thus left open to the poet as subjects of his
representation, it follows likewise, that Beauty "can never be more than
one amongst many resources, (and those the slightest,) by which he has
it in his power to engage our interest for his characters."</p>

<p>It will be remarked, that the purport of Lessing's reasoning, so far as
he has in express terms carried it, is no more than to demonstrate the
important truth, that the Fine Arts are confined by certain limits to
which Poetry is not subject. His elucidation of the principles of poetry
is purely incidental and negative. His reasoning seems however
necessarily to infer certain further consequences, the examination of
which has a tendency to cast additional light on the true end and
character of the poetical art: and it is for this reason rather than
from any difficulty lying in the way of those implied results, that I
wish now to direct your notice to their nature, and the grounds on which
<a name="FNanchor_84:1_135" id="FNanchor_84:1_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_84:1_135" class="fnanchor">[84:1]</a>their soundness rests. <span class="sidenote">Design must represent Form of
permanent feelings.</span> Lessing's second canon does not assume the arts of
design as pursuing any further end than their original and obvious one,
the Representation of Form: it simply directs that only those
appearances of form shall be represented which admit of being conceived
as permanent. <span class="sidenote">The object of Art, a true representation of the
Beautiful.</span> And as the feelings <!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[<a href="./images/85.png">85</a>]</span>which art desires to awaken are
pleasurable, and as forms, considered merely <i>as</i> forms, give pleasure
only when they are beautiful, art would thus be regarded as proposing
for its object nothing beyond a Representation of the Beautiful, and
Verisimilitude in that representation. The first rule of limitation
however implies a great deal more: it looks to forms, not as such, but
as tokens significant of certain qualities not inherent in their own
nature: for the quality which it requires to be possessed by works of
art, is a capability of exciting the imagination to frame for itself
representations of human action and passion; and in this view, those
feelings which the qualities of form considered as such are calculated
to arouse, are no more than an accidental part of the impression which
the representation makes. It appears, therefore, that art <i>may</i> pursue
two different ends,&mdash;the excitement of the feeling which Beauty
inspires, and the excitement of the feeling which has its root in human
Sympathy; and the question at once occurs,&mdash;Is each of these purposes of
art equally a part of its original and proper province? <span class="sidenote">May
it also try to excite feelings inconsistent with the Beautiful,</span>
<span class="sidenote">as Poetry does?</span> Or, since it is sufficiently clear that the
effects which the last-mentioned canon contemplates as produced by the
fine arts, are effects which are also produced by poetry, (whether its
sole effects or not, it is immaterial to this question to settle,) the
question may be put in another form:&mdash;Is it to be believed, that the
arts of design, which have admittedly for one purpose the reproduction
of the Beautiful in form, have also as an equally proper and original
purpose the framing of representations of form calculated to affect the
mind with feelings different from the feeling of the Beautiful,&mdash;these
feelings being identically the same with those which are at least the
most obvious effects of poetry? <span class="sidenote">No.</span> Reasons crowd in upon
the mind, evincing that the question must be answered by an unqualified
negative. The production of poetical effects cannot have been an
<i>original</i> purpose of the fine arts, which certainly were brought into
existence <a name="FNanchor_85:1_136" id="FNanchor_85:1_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_85:1_136" class="fnanchor">[85:1]</a>by the love of Beauty; and the production of those
effects is plainly also an exertion in which the fine arts overstep
their limits, and wander into the region which belongs of right to the
poetical art, and to it alone. <span class="sidenote">Expression in Painting and
Sculpture is a borrowd quality<ins class="corr" title="period missing in original">.</ins></span> That Expression in painting and
sculpture is an extraneous and borrowed quality, is made almost
undeniably evident by this <!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[<a href="./images/86.png">86</a>]</span>one consideration, that it requires, as we
have seen, to be always kept subdued, and allowed to enter only
partially into the composition of the work. <span class="sidenote">That Fine Art is
admired most when it has most expression, only shows that</span> And, again,
it is no argument against that position, to say that the strongest and
most general interest and admiration are excited by those works of art
in which expression is permitted to go the utmost length which the
physical limits of the art permit. <span class="sidenote">Poetry stirs men more than
pure Art does.</span> For the universality of this preference only proves,
that the feelings of our common humanity influence more minds than does
the pure love of the beautiful; and the greater strength of the feeling
produced by expression, only evinces that poetry, which works its effect
by means of that quality, is a more powerful engine than the sister-art
for stirring up the depths of our nature. And it may be quite true that
those works of art which confine themselves to the attempt to move the
calmer feeling due to Beauty, are the truest to their own nature and
proper aim, although an endeavour to unite with that the attainment of
higher purposes may be admissible, and in some instances highly
successful. I apprehend that although an art should propose as its main
end the production of one particular effect, it does not follow that its
effects should be confined to the production of that alone, if its
physical conditions permit the partial pursuit of others. <span class="sidenote">
Fine Art <i>may</i> borrow from its loftier sister, Poetry,</span>More especially,
if an art should admit of uniting, to a certain extent, with its own
peculiar and legitimate end, the prosecution of another loftier than the
first, surely we might expect to find such an art occasionally taking
advantage of the license; and yet its doing so would not compel us to
say, that both these are its proper and original purposes. <span class="sidenote">
but Classic Art very rarely does, and rightly.</span>And the fact is, that
the attempt is seldom made; for very few works of classical art exist in
which the union of the two principles is tried, the end sought being
usually the representation of beauty, and that alone. In no way,
however, can the radical difference and opposition between the two
qualities be evinced so satisfactorily as by a comparison <a name="FNanchor_86:1_137" id="FNanchor_86:1_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_86:1_137" class="fnanchor">[86:1]</a>of the
effects which they severally produce on the mind. <span class="sidenote">Expression
belongs to Poetry. It excites.</span> <span class="sidenote">Poetry stirs men.</span>
Expression, the poetical element, gives rise to a peculiar activity of
the soul, a certain species of reflective emotion, which, it is true, is
easily distinguishable from underived passion, and does not necessarily
produce like it a tendency to action, but which yet essentially partakes
of the character <!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[<a href="./images/87.png">87</a>]</span>of mental commotion, and is opposed to the idea of
mental inactivity. <span class="sidenote">Beauty soothes them.</span> The feeling which
Beauty awakens is of a character entirely opposite. The contemplation of
the Beautiful begets an inclination to repose, a stillness and luxurious
absorption of every mental faculty: thought is dormant, and even
sensation is scarcely followed by the perception which is its usual
consequence. <span class="sidenote">Look at the Venus de Medici.</span> It is with this
softness and relaxation of mind that we are inspired when we look on
such works as the Venus de Medici, in which beauty is sole and supreme,
and expression is permitted to be no farther present than as it is
necessary as an indication of the internal influence of soul, that so
those sympathies may be awakened, without whose partial action even
beauty itself possesses no power. <span class="sidenote">When ancient art stirs you,
as in the</span> If we turn to those few works of ancient art, in which the
opposite element is admitted, we are conscious that the soul is
differently acted upon, and we may be able by reflection to disentangle
the ravelled threads of feeling, and distinguish the mental changes
which flow upon and through each other like the successive waves on the
sea-beach. <span class="sidenote">Apollo and</span> In contemplating the Apollo, for
instance, a feeling akin to the poetical, or rather identical with it,
is awakened by the divine majesty of the statue; and upon the quiet and
self-brooding luxury with which the heart is filled by the perfect
beauty of the youthful outlines, there steals a more fervent emotion
which makes us proud to look on the proud figure, which makes us stand
more erect while we gaze, and imitate involuntarily that godlike
attitude and expression of calm and beautiful disdain. <span class="sidenote">
Laocoon,</span> <span class="sidenote">it is by their having left their own ground, and
taken that of Poetry, Expression.</span> Or look to the wonderful Laocoon, in
which the abstract feeling of beauty is even more deeply merged in the
human feeling of the pathetic,&mdash;that extraordinary groupe, in which
continued meditation arouses more and more actively the emotion of
sympathy, while we view the dark and swimming shadows of the eyes, the
absorbed and motionless agony of the mouth, and the tense torture of the
iron muscles of <a name="FNanchor_87:1_138" id="FNanchor_87:1_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_87:1_138" class="fnanchor">[87:1]</a>the body. It is impossible to conceive that an art
can propose to itself, as originally and properly its own, two ends so
difficult of reconcilement and so different in the qualities by which
they are brought about. <span class="sidenote">Lastly, Fine Art appeals to sight.</span>
<span class="sidenote">Poetry never does.</span> Finally, the Plastic Arts offer form
directly to the sense of sight, whereas it is very doubtful whether
poetry can convey, even indirectly, any visual image. <span class="sidenote">If Fine
Art rightly includes Expression, then it has Beauty too;</span>
<span class="sidenote">while Poetry, which can't express Beauty directly, has to give up part
of its province, Expression, to Art, which can't use it fully.</span> <!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[<a href="./images/88.png">88</a>]</span>Consequently, the result of admitting Expression as a primary and
legitimate end of the arts of form, would be to ascribe to them an
innate and underived capability of presenting directly to the senses
both beauty and the wide circle of human action and feeling; while the
genius of Poetry, by her nature shut out from direct representation of
the beautiful, whose shadows she can evoke only through the agency of
associated ideas, would have even her own kingdom of thought and
passion, her power as the great interpreter of mind, shared with her by
a rival, whom the decision would acknowledge indeed as possessing a
right to the divided empire, but who is disqualified by the nature of
her instruments from exercising that sovereignty to the full. <span class="sidenote">
Poetry rather lends its help to its narrower ally, Art.</span>And, on the
other hand, by the acknowledgment that the arts of form are not properly
a representation of human action or human passion, and that when they
aim at becoming so, they attempt a task which is above and beyond their
sphere, and in which their success can never be more than partial,
Poetry is exhibited in an august and noble aspect, as stooping to lend a
share in her broad and lofty dominion to another art of narrower scope,
which is so enabled to gain over the mind an influence of transcending
its own unassisted capacities.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">The aims of Poetry:</span></p>

<p>If you shall be able to think this excursive disquisition justifiable,
it will be because it insensibly leads us to perceive what truly is the
legitimate and sole end of the Poetical Art, and because it thus clears
the way for one or two elementary propositions regarding the functions
of the Poetical Faculty. <span class="sidenote">1. not to represent Beauty to the
eye,</span> <span class="sidenote">but only to the mind.</span> First, we perceive that poetry
does not aim at the representation of visual beauty. I do not say that
beauty may not form the subject of poetry: my meaning is, that the poet
can depict it poetically in no way except by indicating its effects on
the mind. When poetry mistakingly attempts to represent beauty by its
external form, its failure to affect the mind is signal and complete,
and must be <a name="FNanchor_88:1_139" id="FNanchor_88:1_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_88:1_139" class="fnanchor">[88:1]</a>so, even supposing it to be possible that the picture
should be so full and accurate that the painter might sketch from it.
The reason of this is perhaps discoverable. <span class="sidenote">Contrast of the
effects of Beauty and Expression, of Fine Art and Poetry, on the mind.</span>
Such a description cannot affect the mind with the poetical sentiment,
because it does not represent to the imagination those qualities by
which it is that the poetical effect is <!-- Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[<a href="./images/89.png">89</a>]</span>produced; and if it were to
move the mind at all, it must be with those feelings which beauty
excites when it is seen corporeally present. It fails to operate even
this effect, and why? Beauty of form affects the mind through the
intervention of sense; and the perception of the sensible qualities of
form is followed instantaneously and necessarily by the pleasurable
emotion. <span class="sidenote">Beauty gives pleasure, rest, absorption.</span> This
mental process is involuntary, and the nature of the sentiment excited
implies inactivity and absorption of the mind. <span class="sidenote">Poetry stirs
the Imagination, the Will,</span> <span class="sidenote">disturbs the passiveness that
Beauty produces.</span> When however the imagination is called on to combine
into a connected whole the scattered features which words successively
present, an effort of the will is necessary: and the failure in the
pleasurable effect appears to be adequately accounted for (independently
of any imperfection in the result of the combination) by the
inconsistency of this degree of mental activity with the inert frame of
mind which is requisite for the actual contemplation and enjoyment of
the beautiful. <span class="sidenote">It can't produce an image by sight,</span>
<span class="sidenote">but only by association.</span> When, again, the poet represents
beauty in the method chalked out for him by the nature of his art, it is
quite impossible that he can convey any distinct visual image; for he
represents the poetical qualities by indicating them as the causes which
produce some particular temper or frame of mind: and as every mind has
its distinctive differences of association, a truly poetical picture is
not realised by any two minds with precisely similar features.
<span class="sidenote">Its effect is opposite to that of Beauty of Form.</span> And the
mood of mind to which this representation gives birth, is radically
opposite to the other; it is active, sympathetic, and even reflective:
we seem, as it were, to share the feeling with others, to derive an
added delight from witnessing the manner in which they are affected, or
even to have the original passive sentiment of pleasure entirely
swallowed up in that energetic emotion.<a name="FNanchor_89:1_140" id="FNanchor_89:1_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_89:1_140" class="fnanchor">[89:1]</a>
<span class="sidenote">2. Poetry's true subject is Mind, and not external nature,</span>
Secondly, <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[<a href="./images/90.png">90</a>]</span>the true
subject of poetry is <a name="FNanchor_90:1_141" id="FNanchor_90:1_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_90:1_141" class="fnanchor">[90:1]</a>Mind. Its most strictly original purpose is
that of imaging mind <i>directly</i>, by the representation of humanity as
acting, thinking, or suffering; it presents images of external nature
only because the weakness of the mind compels it; and it is careful to
represent sensible images solely as they are acted on by mind.
<span class="sidenote">except as tinged with thought and feeling.</span> When it makes the
description of external nature its professed end, it in truth does not
represent the sensible objects themselves, but only exhibits certain
modes of thought and feeling, and characterises the sensible forms no
farther than as the causes which produce them. <span class="sidenote">3. Poetry is
analytical; it perceives, discriminates.</span> Thirdly, The most
characteristic function of the poetical faculty is <i>analytical</i>; it is
essentially a <i>perception</i>, a power of discovery, analysis, and
discrimination. An object having been presented to it by the
imagination, it discovers, and separates from the mass of its qualities,
those of them which are calculated to affect the mind with that emotion
which is the instrumental end of poetry. <span class="sidenote">Its combinations
depend on its first analysis.</span> Coincidently with the perception and
discovery of the qualities, it perceives and experiences the peculiar
effect which each particular quality produces; and, lastly, it sets
forth and represents those resulting moods of mind, indicating at the
same time what those qualities of the object are through which they are
excited. Its task of combination is no more than consequent on this
process, and supposes each step of it to have been previously gone
through. <span class="sidenote">4. Poetry depends on the power and accuracy of its
perception of the poetical qualities in its materials.</span> Fourthly, It
follows, (and this is the result which makes the inquiry important,)
that the poetical faculty is measured by the strength and accuracy with
which it perceives the poetical qualities of those objects which the
imagination suggests as its materials, and not by the number of the
ideas so presented. <span class="sidenote">Of imagination or Imagery.</span> A
forgetfulness of this truth has occasioned more misapprehension and
<a name="FNanchor_90:2_142" id="FNanchor_90:2_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_90:2_142" class="fnanchor">[90:2]</a>false criticism than any other error whatever; and we are
continually in danger of the mistake, from the extension of meaning
which use has attached to the word imagination, that term being commonly
employed to designate the poetical faculty. This extended application is
perhaps unavoidable; but it is on that account the more necessary to
guard against the misconception always likely to arise from the original
signification of the word, which we can never discard entirely from the
mind in using it in a secondary sense.&mdash;You do not need to be reminded
how <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[<a href="./images/91.png">91</a>]</span>completely the history of the poetical art evinces, that these
positions, whether expressly acquiesced in or not, have been invariably
acted on in the judgments which the world has pronounced in particular
cases. <span class="sidenote">Describing forms by their outsides, is not Poetry.</span>
<span class="sidenote">They must be shown as exciting changes of Mind.</span> The
inadequacy of a representation of forms by their external attributes to
constitute poetical pictures, could be instanced from every bad poem
which has ever been written; and the great truth, that the external
world is exhibited poetically only by being represented as the exciting
cause of mental changes, has been illustrated in no age so singularly as
in our own. <span class="sidenote">Wordsworth declares that all outward objects can
do this,</span> <span class="sidenote">and become sentient existences.</span> The writings of
Wordsworth in particular have stretched the principle to the utmost
extent which it can possibly sustain; demanding a belief that all
external objects are poetical, because all can interest the human mind;
establishing the reasonableness of the assumption by the boldest
confidence in the strength and delicacy with which the poetical
perception can trace the qualities which awaken that interest, and the
progress of the feeling itself; and applying the poetical faculty to the
transforming of every object of sense into an energetic, and as it were
sentient, existence. <span class="sidenote">Mere wealth of imagery is of little
worth.</span> And attention is especially due to the decision which has always
recognized, as the rule of poetical excellence, the operation of some
power independent of mere wealth of imagination, ranking this latter
quality as one of the lowest merits of poetry. <span class="sidenote">The greatest
poets use the fewest images,</span> We are apt to forget that those minds
whose conceptions have been the most strongly and truly poetical, are by
no means those whose poetical ideas have been the most abundant; that an
overflow of poetical images has been coincident with an intense
perception of their most efficient poetical relations only in a few rare
instances; and that it is precisely where the highest elements of the
poetical are most active that <a name="FNanchor_91:1_143" id="FNanchor_91:1_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_91:1_143" class="fnanchor">[91:1]</a>the imagination is usually found to
offer the fewest images as the materials on which the poetical faculty
should work. <span class="sidenote">witness Dante,</span> <span class="sidenote">Alfieri.</span> It is
enough to name Dante, or, a still more singular instance, Alfieri.
<span class="sidenote">Their intensity is their secret.</span> In both cases the poetical
influence rests on the intensity of the one simple aspect of grandeur or
passion in which a character is presented, and in both that simplicity
is unrelieved and undecorated by any fulness of imagery.<a name="FNanchor_91:2_144" id="FNanchor_91:2_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_91:2_144" class="fnanchor">[91:2]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[<a href="./images/92.png">92</a>]</span>
<span class="sidenote">Application of these principles to the Drama.</span></p>

<p>These fundamental principles of the poetical art possess a closer
application to Dramatic Poetry than to any other species. <span class="sidenote">The
Passions are the chief subjects of Poetry.</span> All poetry being directly or
indirectly a representation of human character; and human character
admitting of appreciation only by an exhibition of its results in
action; and action being prompted by the passionate impulses of the
mind, which its reflective faculties only modify or stay; it follows
that the Passions are the leading subjects of Poetry, which consequently
must be examined in the first instance with a view to its strength and
accuracy as a representation of the working and results of that
department of the mind. The nature of the dramatic art allows this rule
to be applied to it with the greatest strictness. <span class="sidenote">They work
more alone in the Drama than elsewhere.</span> The drama is the species which
presents the essential qualities of poetry less mingled with foreign
adjuncts than they are in any other species; and there seems to be a
cause, (independent of its mechanical necessities,) enabling it to
dispense with those decorations which abound in other kinds of poetry.
The acted drama presents its picture of life directly to the senses, and
permits the imagination, without any previous exertion, to proceed at
once to its proper task of forming its own combinations from the
sensible forms thus offered to it; and even when the drama is read, the
office of the imagination in representing to itself the action and the
characters of the piece, is an easy one, and performed without the
necessity of great activity of mind. <span class="sidenote">In Epic and other poetry
relying only on words, the effort to turn them into a picture hinders
their prompt action.</span> On the other hand, in the epic, or any other
species of poetry which represents action by <a name="FNanchor_92:1_145" id="FNanchor_92:1_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_92:1_145" class="fnanchor">[92:1]</a>words, and not by an
imitation of the action itself, the imagination has at first to form,
from the successively presented features of the poetical description, a
picture which shall be the exciting cause of the poetical impression:
this supposes considerable energy of thought, and the necessity of
relief from that exertion seems to have suggested the introduction of
images of external nature and the like, on which the fancy may rest and
disport itself. <span class="sidenote">Didactic poetry is not true poetry, but
sermons in verse.</span> Those classes of poetry which are either partially or
wholly didactic, cannot receive a strict <!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[<a href="./images/93.png">93</a>]</span>application of the principles
of the pure art; because they are not properly poetry, but attempts to
make poetical forms serve purposes which are not poetical.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Shakspere again.</span></p>

<p>Our journey has at length conducted us to Shakspeare, of many of whose
peculiar qualities we have been gaining scattered glimpses in our
progress. <span class="sidenote">He takes to Drama, because it's the noblest and
truest form of Poetry, the likest the mind of man.</span> We remark him
adopting that species of poetry which, necessarily confined by its
forms, is yet the noblest offspring of the poetical faculty, and the
truest to the purposes of the poetical art, because it is the most
faithful and impressive image of the mind and state of man. <span class="sidenote">
And there he sits enthrond.</span>We find him seated like an eastern
sovereign amidst those who have adopted this highest form of poetry; and
we cannot be contented that, in reverentially acknowledging his
worthiness to fill the throne, we should render him only a hasty and
undiscerning homage. <span class="sidenote">But why?</span> A discrimination of the
particular qualities by which his sway is mainly supported, is rendered
the more necessary by that extraordinary union of qualities, which has
made him what he is, the unapproached and the unapproachable.&mdash;We are
accustomed to lavish commendations on his vast Imagination. <span class="sidenote">
What does his <i>Imagination</i> mean?</span>Before we can perceive what rank this
quality of his deserves to hold in an estimate of his character, we must
understand precisely what the quality is which we mean to praise.
<span class="sidenote">his wealth of imagery?</span> If the term used denotes merely the
abundance of his illustrative conceptions, it expresses what is a
singular quality, especially as co-existent with so many other
endowments, but useful only as furnishing materials for the use of the
poetical power. <span class="sidenote">of fancy, of conception?</span> If the word is
meant to call attention to the strength and delicacy with which his mind
grasps and embodies the poetical relations of those overflowing
conceptions, (still considered simply as illustrative or decorative,)
<a name="FNanchor_93:1_146" id="FNanchor_93:1_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_93:1_146" class="fnanchor">[93:1]</a>the quality indicated is a rare and valuable gift, and is
especially to be noted in an attempt to trace a likeness to his manner.
<span class="sidenote">No.</span> Still however it is but a secondary ground of desert; it
is even imperfectly suited for developement in dramatic dialogue, and it
frequently tempts him to quit the genuine spirit and temper of his
scene. <span class="sidenote">Does Shakspere's imagination mean the grandeur or
loveliness he has given some of his characters?</span> If, again, in speaking
of the great poet's imagination, we have regard to the poetical
character of many of his leading conceptions, to the ideal grandeur or
terror of some of his preternatural characters, or even to the romantic
loveliness which he <!-- Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[<a href="./images/94.png">94</a>]</span>has thrown, like the golden curtains of the
morning, over the youth and love of woman,&mdash;we point out a quality which
is admirable in itself, and almost divine in its union with others so
opposite, a quality to which we are glad to turn for repose from the
more severe portions of his works,&mdash;but still an excellence which is not
the most marked feature of his character, and which he could want
without losing the essential portion of his identity. <span class="sidenote">No.</span>
<span class="sidenote">We could give up</span> <span class="sidenote">Miranda,</span>
<span class="sidenote">Ariel,</span> <span class="sidenote">Juliet, Romeo,</span>
<span class="sidenote">and yet leave the true, the highest Shakspere behind, in Richard,
Macbeth, Lear, Hamlet.</span> We could conceive, (although the idea is
sacrilege to the genius and the altar of poetry,) we could conceive that
'The Tempest' had remained unwritten, that Miranda had not made
inexperience beautiful by the spell of innocence and youth, that the
hideous slave Caliban had never scowled and cursed, nor Ariel alighted
on the world like a shooting-star,&mdash;we could dismiss alike from our
memories the moon-light forest in which the Fairy Court revel, and the
lurid and spectre-peopled ghastliness of the cave of Hecate,&mdash;we
could in fancy remove from the gallery of the poet's art the picture
which exhibits the two self-destroyed lovers lying side by side in the
tomb of the Capulets,&mdash;and we could discard from our minds, and
hold as never having been invented by the poet, all which we find in his
works possessing a character similar to these scenes and figures;&mdash;and
yet we should leave behind that which would support Shakspeare as having
pursued the highest ends of his art, and as having attained those ends
more fully than any other who ever followed them: Richard would still be
his; Macbeth would think and tremble, and Lear weep and be mad; and
Hamlet would still pore over the riddle of life, and find in death the
solution of its mystery. <span class="sidenote">These show his Imagination, the force with
which he throws himself into their characters.</span> If it is to such
characters as these last that we refer when we speak of the poet's power
of imagina<a name="FNanchor_94:1_147" id="FNanchor_94:1_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_94:1_147" class="fnanchor">[94:1]</a>tion, and if we wish to designate by the word the force
with which he throws himself into the conception of those characters,
then we apprehend truly what the sphere is in which his greatness lies,
although we either describe the whole of a most complicated mental
process by naming a single step of it, or load the name of that one
mental act with a weight of meaning which it is unfit to bear.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Shakspere's supremacy lies in his characterization.</span></p>

<p>It is here, in his mode of dealing with human character, that
Shakspeare's supremacy confessedly lies; and the conclusions which <!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[<a href="./images/95.png">95</a>]</span>we
have reached as to the great purpose of poetry, allow us easily to
perceive how excellence in this department justifies the universal
decision, which places at the summit of poetical art the poet who is
pre-eminently distinguished by it. <span class="sidenote">Why is his the best?</span> What
is there in Shakspeare's view of human character which entitles him to
this high praise? <span class="sidenote">How is he true to Nature and imagination?</span>
His truth of painting is usually specified as the source of his
strength; in what sense is he true to nature? Is that faithfulness to
nature consistent with any exercise of the imagination in the
representation of character? And how? And again, how does his reflective
temper of mind harmonize with or arise out of the view of human life
which he takes?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Poetry (or Drama) represent passions.</span></p>

<p>Poetry, as we have seen, and dramatic poetry more strictly than any
other species, must be judged primarily as a representation of passion
and feeling; and when it is defective as such, it has failed in its
proper end. Its prosecution of that end, however, is subject to two
important limitations. <span class="sidenote">But 1. it must show human nature
entirely, both its moving and hindering forces; man's mind as well as
his passions; 2. it must do this impressively, must have a high standard
of character.</span> First, if it is to be in any sense a <i>true</i>
representation of human action, it must represent human nature not
partially, but entirely; it must exhibit not only the moving influences
which produce action, but also the counteracting forces which in real
life always control it. It must be a mirror of the intellectual part of
the human mind, as well as of the passionate. Secondly, if, possessing
the first requisite, truth, it is to be also an <i>impressive</i>
representation, (that is, such a representation as shall effect the ends
of poetical art,) it must set up an ideal and elevated standard to
regulate its choice of the class of intellectual endowment which is to
form the foundation of the characters which it portrays. <span class="sidenote">Ben
Jonson faild in (2), the other Elizabethans in (1).</span> We discover the
cause of Jonson's inferiority in his failure in obedience to the latter
of these rules, though he scrupulously complied with <a name="FNanchor_95:1_148" id="FNanchor_95:1_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_95:1_148" class="fnanchor">[95:1]</a>the first: we
discover the prevailing defect of all the other dramatic writers of that
period, to consist in their neglect even of the first and subsidiary
rule, which involved a complete disregard to the other.&mdash;These latter
have, as well as Shakspeare, been proposed as models, from their close
imitation of nature. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's contemporaries don't imitate
Nature, they distort it, give Passion, and no Reason.</span> The merit of
truth to nature belongs to them only in a very confined sense. They
seize one oblique and partial aspect of human character, and represent
it as giving a true and direct view of the whole; they are the poets of
the passions, and no more; they <!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[<a href="./images/96.png">96</a>]</span>have failed to shadow forth that
control which the calmer principles of our nature always exert over the
active propensities. Their excellence consequently is to be looked for
only in scenes which properly admit the force of unchecked passion, or
of passions conflicting with each other; and in those scenes where the
more thoughtful spirit ought to work, we must be prepared to meet either
exaggeration of feeling or feebleness of thought, either the operation
of an evil principle, or, at best, a defect of the good one. <span class="sidenote">
They like to show the mind in delirium.</span>Even in their passionate
scenes, the vigour of the drawing is the merit oftener than the
faithfulness of the portrait; they delight to figure the human mind as
in a state of delirium, with the restraining forces taken off, and the
passions and the imagination boiling, as if the brain were maddened by
opiates or fever. Fierce and exciting visions come across the soul in
such a paroxysm; and in the intensity of its stimulated perceptions, it
gazes down into the abysses of nature, with a profound though transitory
quickness of penetration. It is a high merit to have exhibited those
partial views of nature, or even this exaggerated phasis of the mind;
and the praise is shared by no dramatic school whatever; (for the
qualities of the ancient are different;) but it must not be assumed that
the drama fulfils its highest purposes, by representations so partial,
so distorted, or so disproportioned. <span class="sidenote">They are poets of
impulse.</span> As these poets of impulse bestowed no part of their attention
on the intellect in any view, they produced their peculiar effect, such
as it was, without any attempt at that higher task of selection and
elevation in intellectual character for which the universality of views
which they wanted must always serve as the foundation. <span class="sidenote">Ben
Jonson as broad in aim as Shakspere.</span> They had accordingly little scope
for the due introduction of reflection in their works; and their turn of
mind inclined them little to <a name="FNanchor_96:1_149" id="FNanchor_96:1_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_96:1_149" class="fnanchor">[96:1]</a>search for it when it did not
naturally present itself.&mdash;Jonson resembled Shakspeare in wideness of
aim: he is most unlike him in the method which he adopted in the pursuit
of his end. <span class="sidenote">Ben Jonson tried at truth to nature,</span> The two
stood alone in their age and class, as alone aiming at truth to nature
in any sense; both wished to read each of the opposite sides of the
scroll of human character: but the one read correctly the difficult
writing in which intellectual character is traced, while the other
misapprehended and misinterpreted its meaning, and even allowed the
<!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[<a href="./images/97.png">97</a>]</span>eagerness with which he perused this perplexing page, to withdraw his
attention from the more easy meaning of the other. <span class="sidenote">but drew
individuals only, portraits of reality, but no types,</span> The fault of his
characters as intellectual beings, is that they are individuals and no
more; faithful or grotesque portraits of reality, they are not touched
with that purple light which affords insight into universal relations
and hidden causes. <span class="sidenote">not poetic creations.</span> His failure is
shewn by its effect: his characters are not so conceived as to lead the
mind to the comprehension of anything beyond their own individual
peculiarities, or to elevate it into that region of active and
conceptive contemplation into which it is raised by the finest class of
poetry: he exhibited reality as reality, and not in its relation to
possibility; he even diverges into the investigation of causes, instead
of seeing them at a glance, and indicating them by effects; he
anatomised human life, and hung up its dry bones along the walls of his
study.</p>

<p>In the close obedience which Shakspeare rendered to each of these two
canons, borne in upon his mind by the instantaneous suggestions of his
happy genius, we may discover the origin of his tremendous power.
<span class="sidenote">Shakspere's power lay in</span> <span class="sidenote">subordinating Fancy and
Passion to Intellect.</span> To commence at the point where his adherence to
the first and subsidiary rule is most slightly manifested, it is to be
noticed, that his works are marked throughout by a predominance of the
qualities of the understanding over the fancy and the passions. This is
not true of the fundamental conception of the work, nor of the relations
by which his characters are united into the dramatic groupes; in these
particulars the poetical faculty is allowed to work freely: but it is
after the initial steps have been taken under her guidance, that the
rule is committed to the sterner power of intellect. The stir of fancy
often breaks through the restraints which hold it in check; the warmth
of feeling effervesces very unfrequently. <span class="sidenote">All his characters
have quiet good sense.</span> <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's shrewdness in his minor
scenes.</span> The poet's personages <a name="FNanchor_97:1_150" id="FNanchor_97:1_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_97:1_150" class="fnanchor">[97:1]</a>are all more or less marked by an
air of quiet sense, which is extremely unusual in poetry, and
incompatible with the unnecessary or frequent display of feeling; and
accordingly, his less important scenes, whether they be gay or serious,
occupied in the business of the drama, or devoted to an exchange of
witty sallies, possess, where they aim at nothing higher, at least a
degree of intellectual shrewdness, which very often savours of worldly
coldness. <span class="sidenote">His soberness gives force to his passion.</span> Viewed
merely as increasing the effect of his passionate scenes, this
prevailing <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[<a href="./images/98.png">98</a>]</span>sobriety of tone gives him an incalculable advantage:
passion in his works bursts out when it is let loose, like the spring of
a mastiff unchained. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's sober rationality.</span> It is of
this quality, his sober rationality, that we are apt to think when we
acknowledge his truth of representation; and the excellence is
indispensable to truth in any sense, because the want of it gives birth
to imperfection and distortion of views; but I apprehend that it is to
his aiming at a higher purpose that we have to look for the genuine
source of his power. <span class="sidenote">But he didn't reproduce the bare
reality.</span> While we mark the gradual rise of the intellectual element of
poetical character upwards from its lowest stage, we are in truth
approximating to a rule which issues in something beyond a bare and
unselected reproduction of reality. <span class="sidenote">Poetry aims at</span>
<span class="sidenote">general truth,</span> <span class="sidenote">brings out the relation of one
mind to universal nature;</span> <span class="sidenote">it idealizes and ennobles
realities.</span> Poetry aims at representing the whole of man's nature; and
yet a picture of human character, embracing all its features, but
neither skilfully selecting its aspect nor majestically combining its
component parts, would not effect the ends of poetry: for that art
contemplates not individual but general truth, not that which is really
produced, but that which may be conceived without doing violence to
acknowledged principles; instead of presenting a bare portraiture of
mental changes, it exhibits them in an aspect which teaches their
relation to the system of universal nature; it is seemingly conversant
with facts, but it imperceptibly hints at causes; it aims at exciting
the imagination to frame pictures for itself, and for that reason, if
for no other, it must be permitted to idealize and ennoble the
individual realities from which its materials are collected. <span class="sidenote">
A Painting pictured a soldier in the midst of foes, yet showd him
alone.</span>The mode in which poetry affects the mind is illustrated by the
description which we read of a certain ancient painting. That piece
represented a young soldier surrounded by several enemies and
desperately defending himself; but his own figure alone was
<a name="FNanchor_98:1_151" id="FNanchor_98:1_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_98:1_151" class="fnanchor">[98:1]</a>admitted into the field of view, and the motions and place of his
unseen enemies were indicated solely by the life, energy, and
significance of the attitude in which he was drawn. Shakspeare's
attachment to truth of representation never tempted him to forget the
true purpose of his art. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere is true to nature in
Poetry's way.</span> <span class="sidenote">His characters</span> <span class="sidenote">are not monsters of
evil,</span> While he is true to nature by attempting the treatment of his
whole subject, he is true to it in the manner and with the restrictions
which the nature of poetry requires; he is true to principles which
admit of being conceived as producing effects, not to effects
individually <!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>[<a href="./images/99.png">99</a>]</span>observed as resulting; the creatures of his conception
possess no qualities which unfit them for exciting the mind as poetical
character should excite it; they are not repulsive by the unexampled and
unatoned for congregation of evil qualities, not mean by the absence of
lofty thought, not devoid of poetical significance by confining the
imagination to the qualities by which they are individually marked.
<span class="sidenote">nor are they above the influence of evil.</span> You will
particularly remark, that, while he had to bring out the features of his
characters by subjecting them to tragic and calamitous events, he was
careful not to figure them as unsusceptible of the influence of those
external evils. <span class="sidenote">Brutus is his one stoical character.</span> The
lofty view which he took of human nature did indeed admit the idea of a
resistance to calamity, and a triumph over it, based on internal and
conscious grandeur; but this is an aspect in which he does not present
the human mind; the stoical Brutus is the only character in which he has
attempted such a conception, which he has there developed but partially.
But while he was contented, even in his noblest characters, to represent
passion in all its strength and directed towards its usual objects, he
had open to him sources of tragic strength unknown to those poets who
describe passion only. Where passion alone is represented, no spectacle
is so agitating as the conflict of contending passions; and the
narrowness of such views of nature permits that tragic opposition to be
no further exhibited. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere dealt not with the conflict
of Passions only, but with the strife between the Passions and the
Reason,</span> Shakspeare had before him a wider field of contrast&mdash;the
conflict between the passions and the reason&mdash;a struggle between powers
inspired with deadly animosity, and each, as he conceived them,
possessed of gigantic strength. <span class="sidenote">convulsing the whole being of
man.</span> He has worthily represented that terrible encounter, engaging
every principle and faculty of the soul, and shaking the whole kingdom
of man's being with <a name="FNanchor_99:1_152" id="FNanchor_99:1_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_99:1_152" class="fnanchor">[99:1]</a>internal convulsions. It is in such
representations that his power is mainly felt; and his pictures are at
the same time truest to nature and most faithful to the ends of tragic
art, by the subjugation of the intellectual principle which is the
catastrophe of the strife. The reason is assaulted by calamity from
without, and borne down by an host of rebellious feelings attacking it
internally. <span class="sidenote">Characters showing this mental strife, are
specially dear to Shakspere.</span> It is to the delineation of such
characters as afford scope for this exhibition of mental commotion that
Shakspeare has especially attached himself: the thoughtful and
reflective in <!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[<a href="./images/100.png">100</a>]</span>character is at once his favourite resort, and the field
of his triumph.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">He chose the intellectual and reflective in character.</span></p>

<p>The poet's selection of the intellectual and reflective in character, as
the subject of his art, is thus indicated as his guiding principle, to
whose operation all other principles and rules are but subservient. The
reflective element however is in excess with Shakspeare, and its undue
prevalence is not destitute of harmony with the principle which produces
its legitimately moderated effects. <span class="sidenote">He's a Gnomic Poet.</span> He
is a Gnomic Poet; and he is so, because he is emphatically the poet of
man. <span class="sidenote">The solemnity of meditation is thro' all his soul.</span> He
pauses, he reflects, he aphorizes; because, looking on life and death as
he looked on them, viewing the nature of man from so lofty a station,
and with a power of vision so far-reaching, so acute, and so delicate,
it was impossible but the deepest solemnity of meditation should diffuse
itself through all the chambers of his soul. <span class="sidenote">He makes his
people hint the principles beneath the shews.</span> His enunciations of
general truth are often serious and elevated even in his gayer works;
and where the scene denied him an opportunity of introducing these in
strict accordance with the business of the drama, he makes his
personages, as it were, step out of the groupe, to meditate on the
meanings of the scene, to hold a delicately implied communication with
the spectator, and to hint the general maxims and principles which lurk
beneath the tragic and passionate shews. He has gone beyond this: he has
brought on the stage characters whose sole task is meditation, whose
sole purpose in the drama is the suggesting of high and serious
reflection. <span class="sidenote">Jaques, in <i>As You Like It</i>, is like a Greek
chorus, which</span> Jaques is the perfection of such a character; and the
office which he discharges bears more than a fanciful likeness in
conception to the task of the ancient chorus. <span class="sidenote">gave the
key-note to the audience.</span> That forgotten appendage of the Grecian drama
originated indeed from incidental causes; but, being continued as a part
of the dramatic plan, <a name="FNanchor_100:1_153" id="FNanchor_100:1_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_100:1_153" class="fnanchor">[100:1]</a>it had a momentous duty assigned to it: it
suggested, it interpreted, it sympathised, it gave the key-note to the
reflections of the audience. <span class="sidenote">The highest art made Shakspere
insert his reflective passages in his plays.</span> A profound sense of the
highest purposes and responsibilities of the art prompted this
employment of the choral songs; and no way dissimilar was the impression
which dictated to Shakspeare the introduction of the philosophically
cynical lover of nature in that one play, and the breaks of reflection
so frequent with him in many others.&mdash;It is <!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[<a href="./images/101.png">101</a>]</span>worthy of remark, that this
spirit of penetrating thought, ranging from every-day wisdom to
philosophical abstraction, never becomes morose or discontented.<a name="FNanchor_101:1_154" id="FNanchor_101:1_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_101:1_154" class="fnanchor">[101:1]</a>
Man is a selfish being, but not a malignant one; yet the acts resulting
from the two dispositions are often very similar, and it is the error of
the misanthrope to mistake the one for the other. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere
never made the misanthrope's mistake.</span> <span class="sidenote">His sarcasm did not
spring from envy.</span> Shakspeare's well-balanced mind was in no danger of
this mistake; his keen-sightedness often makes him sarcastic, but the
sarcasm forced on a mind which contrasts the poorness of reality with
the splendours of imagination, is of a different temper from that which
is bred from lowness of thought and fretful envy. <span class="sidenote"><i>Timon's</i></span>
<span class="sidenote">sternness is softened by tenderness.</span> Shakspeare has devoted
one admirable drama to the exhibition of the misanthrophic spirit, as
produced by wrongs in a noble heart; but the sternness which is the
master-note of that work is softened by the most beautiful intervals of
redeeming tenderness and good feeling. <span class="sidenote"><i>Troilus</i> is
Shakspere's only bitter play.</span> The only work of his evidently written in
ill humour with mankind, is the Troilus, which, both in idea and
execution, is the most bitter of satires.</p>

<p>The application of the distinctive qualities of Shakspeare's tone of
thought to the spirit of 'The Two Noble Kinsmen', is a task for your own
judgment and discrimination, and would not be aided by suggestions of
mine. I have stated the result to which I have been led by such an
application; and I am confident that you will be able to reach the same
conclusion by a path which may be shorter than any which I could clear
for you. In connection however with this inquiry, I would direct your
attention to one other truth possessing a clear application here.
<span class="sidenote">Shakspere's thoughtfulness a Moral distinction.</span> Shakspeare's
thoughtfulness goes the length of becoming a Moral distinction and
excellence. <span class="sidenote">His part of <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i> is of higher
tone, and purer, than Fletcher's.</span> That such a difference does exist
between Shakspeare and Fletcher, is denied by no one; and the moral tone
of this play, in those parts which I have <a name="FNanchor_101:2_155" id="FNanchor_101:2_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_101:2_155" class="fnanchor">[101:2]</a>ventured to call
Shakspeare's, is distinctly a higher one than Fletcher's. It is uniform
and pure, though the moral inquisition is less severe than Shakspeare's
often is. <span class="sidenote">Massinger and Ben Jonson too more moral than
Fletcher.</span> If Massinger or Jonson had been the poet alleged to have
written part or the whole of the work, it would have been difficult to
draw any inference from this circumstance by itself; but when the
question is only between Shakspeare and Fletcher, even an abstinence
<!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[<a href="./images/102.png">102</a>]</span>from gross violation or utter concealment of moral truth is an
important element in the decision; and the positively high strain here
maintained is a very strong argument in favour of the purer writer.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Are Johnson, &amp;c. right in condemning Shakspere's morality.</span></p>

<p>I am tempted, however, to carry you somewhat further on this head,
because I must confess that I cannot see the grounds on which Johnson
and others have rested their sweeping condemnation of Shakspeare's
morality. There is, it must be admitted, much to blame, but there is
also something worthy of praise; and praise on this score is what
Shakspeare has scarcely ever received. <span class="sidenote">He admits
licentiousness</span> He has been charged with licentiousness, and justly; but
even in this particular there are some circumstances of palliation,
besides the equivocal plea of universal example, and the doubt which
exists whether most of his grosser dialogues are not interpolations.
<span class="sidenote">and coarse speech.</span> Mere coarseness of language may offend
the taste, and yet be so used as to give no foundation for any heavier
charge. <span class="sidenote">But who can be tainted by Othello's words?</span> There
surely never was a mind which could receive one evil suggestion from the
language wrung from the agonized Othello. Even where this excuse does
not hold, Shakspeare preserves one most important distinction quite
unknown to his contemporaries. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's contemporaries
make their heroes loose livers.</span> By them, looseness of dialogue is
introduced indifferently anywhere in the play, licentiousness of
incident is admitted in any part of the plot, and debauchery of life is
attributed without scruple to those persons in whom interest is chiefly
meant to be excited. <span class="sidenote">He doesn't,</span> It may be safely stated
that Shakspeare almost invariably follows a rule exactly opposite. His
inferior characters may be sometimes gross and sensual; his principal
personages scarcely ever are so: these he refuses to degrade needlessly,
by attributing to them that carelessness of moral restraint of which
Fletcher's men of pleasure are so usually guilty. <span class="sidenote">except in
two plays.</span> There are only two plays<a name="FNanchor_102:1_156" id="FNanchor_102:1_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_102:1_156" class="fnanchor">[102:1]</a> in which he <a name="FNanchor_102:2_157" id="FNanchor_102:2_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_102:2_157" class="fnanchor">[102:2]</a>has
violated this rule, exclusively of some unguarded expressions elsewhere.</p>

<p>But the language which has been held on this question would lead us to
believe that his guilt extends further,&mdash;that he is totally insensible
to any moral distinctions, and blind to moral aims and <!-- Page 103 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[<a href="./images/103.png">103</a>]</span>influences.
<span class="sidenote">Most of Shakspere's contemporaries made pleasure the law of
their heroes' lives.</span> Of most dramatic writers of his time this charge
is too true. Their characters act because they will, not because they
ought,&mdash;for happiness, and not from duty:&mdash;the lowness of their aim may
be disguised, but it is inherent, and cannot be eradicated. We might
read every work of Fletcher's without discovering (if we were ignorant
of the fact before) that there exists for man any principle of action
loftier in its origin than his earthly nature, or more extended in its
object than the life which that nature enjoys. But nothing of this is
true as to Shakspeare. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's morality not of the
loftiest, not like Milton's and</span> That his morality is of the loftiest
sort cannot be asserted. <span class="sidenote">Michel Angelo's.</span> He does not, like
Milton, look out on life at intervals from the windows of his
sequestered hermitage, only to turn away from the sight and indulge in
the most fervent aspirations after immortal purity, and the deepest
adoration of uncreated power; nor does he grovel in the dust with that
ascetic humiliation and religious sense of guilt which overcame the
strong spirit of Michel Angelo. But he shares much of the solemnity of
moral feeling which possesses all great minds, though in him its
influence was restrained by external causes. <span class="sidenote">He was in the
world, and often of it,</span> He moves in the hurried pageant of the world,
and sometimes wants leisure to moralize the spectacle; and even when he
does pause to meditate, the world often hangs about his heart, and he
thinks of life as men in action are apt to think of it. <span class="sidenote">but
evil, to him, was evil, moral law was always shown supreme. Note the
general moral truth in his Tragedies.</span> But moral truth, seldom lost
sight of, is never misrepresented: evil is always described as being
evil: the great moral rule, though often stated as inoperative, is
always acknowledged as binding. Read carefully any of his more lofty
tragedies, and ponder the general truths there so lavishly scattered;
and you will find that an immense proportion of those apophthegms have a
moral bearing, often a most solemn and impressive one. <span class="sidenote">Even
in Comedy his reflections are moral.</span> Even in his lighter plays there is
much of the same spirit: in all he is often thoughtful, and he is never
long thoughtful without becoming morally didactic. This is much in any
poet, and especially in a drama<a name="FNanchor_103:1_158" id="FNanchor_103:1_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_103:1_158" class="fnanchor">[103:1]</a>tist, who exhibits humanity
directly as active, and is under continual temptations to forget what
action tempts men to forget in real life. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere right in
letting evil prevail, so long as he shows it evil.</span> His neglect of duly
distributing punishment and reward is no moral fault, so long as moral
truth is kept sight of in characterizing actions, while that neglect is
borrowed closely from reality. And the same thing is true <!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[<a href="./images/104.png">104</a>]</span>of his
craving wish for describing human guilt, and darkening even his fairest
characters with the shadows of weakness and sin. <span class="sidenote">Dramatic
poetry is truest when it shows man most the slave of evil.</span> The poetry
which depicts man in action is then unfortunately truest when it
represents him as most deeply enslaved by the evil powers which surround
him. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere bared man's soul,</span> Different poets have
proceeded to different lengths in the degree of influence which they
have assigned to the evil principle: most have feared to draw wholly
aside the veil which imagination always struggles to keep before the
nakedness of man's breast; and Shakspeare, by tearing away the curtain
with a harsher hand, has but enabled himself to add a tremendously
impressive element of truth to the likeness which his portrait otherwise
bears to the original. <span class="sidenote">and probed it to its depth.</span>
<span class="sidenote">This is why we hold to him.</span> His view of our state and nature
is often painful; but it is its reality that makes it so; and he would
have wanted one of his strongest holds on our hearts if he had probed
them less profoundly; it is by his unflinching scrutiny of mortal
infirmity that he has forged the very strongest chain which binds us to
his footstool. <span class="sidenote">He durst not paint good triumphant over evil,
because he knew in life it was not so.</span> He reverences human nature where
it deserves respect: he knows man's divinity of mind, and harbours and
expresses the loftiest of those hopes which haunt the heart like
recollections: he represents worthily and well the struggle between good
and evil, but he feared to represent the better principle as victorious:
he had looked on life till observation became prophetical, and he could
not fable that as existing which he sorrowfully saw could never be.
<span class="sidenote">Macbeth,</span> <span class="sidenote">Othello,</span>
<span class="sidenote">Hamlet, sink under their temptations.</span> The milk of human kindness in the bosom of Macbeth
is turned to venom by the breath of an embodied fiend; the tempered
nobility and gentleness of the Moor are made the craters through which
his evil passions blaze out like central fires; and in the wonderful
Hamlet, hate to the guilty pollutes the abhorrence of the
crime,&mdash;irresolution waits on consciousness,&mdash;and the misery of doubt
clings to the solemnity of meditation. <span class="sidenote">And so do we.</span> This is
an awful representation of the human soul; but is it <a name="FNanchor_104:1_159" id="FNanchor_104:1_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_104:1_159" class="fnanchor">[104:1]</a>not a true
one? <span class="sidenote">Man's history is written in blood and tears.</span>
<span class="sidenote">Shakspere's view of life the fittest to give us to the truth.</span>
The sibylline volume of man's history is open before us, and every page of
it is written in blood or tears. And not only are such views of human
fate the truest, but they are those which are most fitted to arouse the
mind to serious, to lofty, even to religious contemplation,&mdash;to guide it
to the fountains of moral truth,&mdash;to lead it to meditations on the dark
<!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[<a href="./images/105.png">105</a>]</span>foundations of our being,&mdash;to direct its gaze forward on that great
journey of the soul, in which mortal life is but a single step.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Analogy of this inquiry.</span></p>

<p>Oftener than once in this inquiry, I have acted towards you like one
who, undertaking to guide a traveller through a beautiful valley, should
frequently lead him out of the beaten road to climb precipitous
eminences, promising that the delay in the accomplishment of the journey
should be compensated by the pleasure of extensive prospects over the
surrounding region. Conduct like this would be excusable in a guide, if
the person escorted had leisure for the divergence, and it would be
incumbent on him if the acquisition of a knowledge of the country were
one of the purposes of the journey; but in either case the labour of the
ascents would be recompensed to the traveller, only if the landscapes
presented were interesting and distinctly seen. <span class="sidenote">Aims of this
treatise;</span> For similar reasons, my endeavour to propose wider views than
the subject necessarily suggested, has, I conceive, been fully
justifiable; but it is for you to decide whether the attempt has been so
far successful as to repay your exertions in attending my excursive
steps. <span class="sidenote">1. from Shakspere's studies, to distinguish between
him and his coevals.</span> The first of our lengthened digressions has
allowed us to combine the known facts as to the kind and amount of
Shakspeare's studies, and to draw from them certain conclusions, which I
cannot think altogether valueless, as to some distinctions between him
and his dramatic coevals, and as to the source of some peculiarities of
his which have been visited with heavy censure. <span class="sidenote">2. to trace
the most characteristic qualities of his thought.</span> In the second
instance in which we have branched off from the main argument, we have
been led to reflect on the most characteristic qualities of the poet's
mode of thought. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's variety of faculty.</span> If there be
any truth or distinctness in the hints which have been imperfectly and
hastily thrown out on this head, your own mind will classify, modify, or
extend them; and, never forgetting what is <a name="FNanchor_105:1_160" id="FNanchor_105:1_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_105:1_160" class="fnanchor">[105:1]</a>the fundamental
principle of the great poet's strength, you will regard that essential
quality with the more lively admiration, when you discriminate the
operations of the power from the working of those other principles which
minister to it, and when you remark the number, the variety, the
opposition of the mental faculties, which are all thus enlisted under
the banners of the one intense and <!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[<a href="./images/106.png">106</a>]</span>almost philosophical Perception of
Dramatic Truth. <span class="sidenote">He, the stern inquisitor into man's heart,</span>
That stern inquisition into the human heart, which the finest sense of
dramatic perfection elevates into the ideal, and the richest fancy
touches with poetical repose, will awaken in your mind a softened
solemnity of feeling, like that under whose sway we have both wandered
in the mountainous forests which skirt our native river; the continuous
and gloomy canopy of the gigantic pines hanging over-head like a dungeon
roof, while the green sward which was the pavement of the woodland
temple, and the lines of natural columns which bounded its retiring
avenues, were flooded with the glad illumination of the descending
sunset. <span class="sidenote">the anxious searcher into truth, is yet the happiest
creator of beauty: the 'maker' of Ric. III. and Iago as well as Juliet
and Titania; of Macbeth as well as Hamlet.</span> We reflect with wonder that
the most anxious of all poetical inquirers into truth, is also the most
powerful painter of unearthly horrors, and the most felicitous creator
of romantic or imaginary beauty; that the poet of Richard and Iago is
also the poet of Juliet, of Ariel, and of Titania; that the fearfully
real self-torture, the judicially inflicted remorse, of Macbeth, is set
in contrast with the wildest figures which superstitious imagination
ever conceived; that on the same canvas on which Hamlet stands as a
personification of the Reason of man shaken by the assaults of evil
within him and without, the gates of the grave are visibly opened, and
the dead ascend to utter strange secrets in the ear of night. <span class="sidenote">
His faculties early expanded consistently, and workt thro' all his life
actively.</span>But even this union is less extraordinary than the regular
and unparalleled consistency with which the poet's faculties early
expanded themselves, and the full activity with which through life all
continued to work. <span class="sidenote">Homer ebbd,</span> Even the dramatic soul of
Homer ebbed like the sea, sinking in old age into the substitution of
wild and minutely told adventure for the historical portraiture of
mental grandeur and passionate strength. <span class="sidenote">Milton sank poetry
in polemics.</span> The youth of Milton brooded over the love and loveliness
of external nature; it was not till his maturity of years that he soared
into the empyrean or descended sheer into the secrets of the abyss; and
<a name="FNanchor_106:1_161" id="FNanchor_106:1_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_106:1_161" class="fnanchor">[106:1]</a>advancing age brought weakness with it, and quenched in the
morass of polemical disputation the torch which had flamed with sacred
light. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere alone flowd full tide on.</span>
<span class="sidenote">Experience came soon to him; Fancy abode with him to the end.</span>
Shakspeare alone was the same from youth to age; in youth no
imperfection, in age no mortality or decay; he performed in his early
years every department of the task which he had to perform, and he
laboured in it with <!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>[<a href="./images/107.png">107</a>]</span>unexhausted and uncrippled energies till the bowl
was broken at the fountain; experience visited him early, fancy lingered
with him to the last; the rapid developement of his powers was an
indication of the internal strength of his genius; their steady
continuance was a type and prognostic of the perpetual endurance of his
sway. <span class="sidenote">Gloster (Ric. III.) was early, Shylock and Hamlet of
middle time, Lear in ripe age,</span> <span class="sidenote"><i>The Tempest</i>, near his
death.</span> The cold and fiendish Gloster was an early conception; the eager
Shylock and the superhuman Hamlet were imagined simultaneously not long
afterwards; the tenderness of Lear was the fruit of the poet's ripest
age; and one of the closing years of his life gave birth to the savage
wildness and the youthful and aerial beauty of 'The Tempest.'</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Are you convinc't that Shakspere wrote much of <i>The Two Noble
Kinsmen</i>?</span></p>

<p>Our last words are claimed by the proper subject of our inquiry. Have I
convinced you that in the composition of 'The Two Noble Kinsmen',
Shakspeare had the extensive participation which I have ascribed to him?
It is very probable that my reasoning is in many parts defective; but I
place so much confidence in the goodness of the cause itself, that I
would unhesitatingly leave the question, without a word of argument, to
be determined by any one, possessing a familiar acquaintance with both
the poets whose claims are to be balanced, and an ordinarily acute
discernment of their distinguishing qualities. <span class="sidenote">I'm sure the
question needs only attention.</span> I am firmly persuaded that the subject
needs only to have attention directed to it; and my investigation of it
cannot have been a failure in every particular. <span class="sidenote">The external
evidence doesn't include the internal.</span> The circumstances attending the
first publication of the drama do not, in the most unfavourable view
which can with any fairness be taken of them, exclude us from deciding
the question of Shakspeare's authorship by an examination of the work
itself: and it is unnecessary that the effect of the external evidence
should be estimated one step higher. <span class="sidenote">Does that give all the
play to Fletcher?</span> Do the internal proofs allot all to Fletcher, or
assign any share to Shakspeare? <span class="sidenote">The Story is alien to
Fletcher</span> The Story is ill-suited for the dramatic purposes <a name="FNanchor_107:1_162" id="FNanchor_107:1_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_107:1_162" class="fnanchor">[107:1]</a>of
the one poet, and belongs to a class of subjects at variance with his
style of thought, and not elsewhere chosen by him or any author of the
school to which he belonged; both the individual and the class accord
with the whole temper and all the purposes of the other poet, and the
class is one from which he has repeatedly selected themes. <span class="sidenote">
Fletcher can't have chosen the subject of <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>; nor
was its plan his.</span> <!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>[<a href="./images/108.png">108</a>]</span>It is next to impossible that Fletcher can have
selected the subject; it is not unlikely that Shakspeare may have
suggested it; and if the execution of the plan shall be thought to
evince that he was in any degree connected with the work, we can hardly
avoid the conclusion that it was by him that the subject was chosen. The
proof here, (which I think has not been noticed by any one before me,)
seems to me to be stronger than in any other branch of the argument.
<span class="sidenote">Its Scenical Arrangement is like Shakspere's.</span> The Scenical
Arrangement of the drama offers points of resemblance to Shakspeare,
which, at the very least, have considerable strength when they are taken
together, and are corroborative of other circumstances. <span class="sidenote">Its
Execution is, in great part, so like his,</span> The Execution of that large
proportion of the drama which has been marked off as his, presents
circumstances of likeness to him, so numerous that they cannot possibly
have been accidental, and so strikingly characteristic that we cannot
conceive them to be the product of imitation. <span class="sidenote">that many
passages must be set down to him.</span> Even if it should be doubted whether
Shakspeare chose the subject, or arranged any part of the plot, it seems
to me that his claim to the authorship of these individual parts needs
only examination to be universally admitted; not that I consider the
proof here as stronger than that which establishes his choice of the
plot, but because it is of a nature to be more easily and intuitively
comprehended.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Look at all the circumstances together,</span></p>

<p>In forming your opinion, you will be careful to view the circumstances,
not singly, but together, and to give each point of resemblance the
support of the others. <span class="sidenote">and see whether the many probabilities
do not make a certainty.</span> It may be that every consideration suggested
may not affect your mind with equal strength of conviction; but numerous
probabilities all tending the same way are sufficient to generate
positive certainty: and it argues no imperfection in a result that it is
brought out only by combined efforts. In those climates of the New World
which you have visited, a spacious and lofty chamber receives a
diffusive shower of light through a single narrow aperture, while in our
cloudy region we can gather sufficient light for our apart<a name="FNanchor_108:1_163" id="FNanchor_108:1_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_108:1_163" class="fnanchor">[108:1]</a>ments
only by opening large and numerous windows: the end is not gained in the
latter case without greater exertion than that which is required in the
former, but it is attained equally in both; for the aspect of our
habitations is not less cheerful than that of yours.</p>

<p><!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>[<a href="./images/109.png">109</a>]</span>
On the absolute merit of the work, I do not wish to anticipate your
judgment. <span class="sidenote">Shakspere's part in <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, is but
a sketch; yet it's better than some of his finisht works.</span> So far as
Shakspeare's share in it is concerned, it can be regarded as no more
than a sketch, which would be seen to great disadvantage beside finished
drawings of the same master. Imperfect as it is, however, it would, if
it were admitted among Shakspeare's acknowledged works, outshine many,
and do discredit to none. It would be no unfair trial to compare it with
those works of his in which he abstains from his more profound
investigations into human nature, permitting the poetical world actively
to mingle with the dramatic, and the radiant spirit of hope to embrace
the sterner genius of knowledge. <span class="sidenote">Compare it with the
<i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>;</span> <span class="sidenote">the colouring and outline are
from the same hand. But best, set it beside <i>Henry VIII.</i></span> We may call
up before us the luxurious fancies of the 'Midsummer Night's Dream', or
even the sylvan landscapes of the Forest of Ardennes, and the pastoral
groupes which people it; and we shall gladly acknowledge a similar
though harsher style of colouring, and a strength of contour indicating
the same origin. But perhaps there is none of his works with which it
could be so fairly compared as 'Henry VIII'. <span class="sidenote">It's more like
that, and nearly as good.</span> In the tone of sentiment and imagination, as
well as in other particulars, I perceive many circumstances of likeness,
which it will gratify you to trace for yourself. The resemblance is more
than a fanciful one, and the neglected play does not materially suffer
by the comparison.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i> ought to be in every '<i>Shakspere's
Works</i>.'</span></p>

<p>This drama will never receive the praise which it merits, till it shall
have been admitted among Shakspeare's undoubted works; and, I repeat, it
is entitled to insertion if any one of the conclusions to which I have
attempted to lead you be sound,&mdash;if it be true that he wrote all, or
most, or a few, of those portions of it, which more competent judges
than I have already confidently ascribed to him. Farewell.</p>

allusions, extending through several lines, to the every-way luckless
jailor's daughter. If I conceal the fact from you, you will, on finding
it out for yourself, suspect that I consider it as making against my
hypothesis, which assigns those episodical adventures to a different
author from this scene. Be assured that I do not regard it in that
light. It is plain that the underplot, however bad, has been worked up
with much pains; and we can conceive that its author would have been
loth to abandon it finally in the incomplete posture in which the fourth
scene of this act left it. Ten lines in this scene sufficed to end the
story, by relating the cure of the insane girl; and there can have been
no difficulty in their introduction, even on my supposition of this
scene being the work of the other author. If the two wrote at the same
time, the poet who wrote the rest of the scene may have inserted them on
the suggestion of the other; or if the drama afterwards came into the
hands of that other, (which there seems some reason to believe,) he
could easily insert them for himself. In any view these lines are no
argument against my theory.</p></div>

of giving pleasure through its innate qualities, ascribes its effects
exclusively to the associated ideas which the contemplation of it calls
up, proceeds wholly on the assumption, that the sentiment awakened by
Beauty when it is beheld bodily present, is the same with that which
flows from a poetical description of it. If it be true (as I must
believe it is) that the feelings in the two cases are essentially
different, the hypothesis falls to the ground. Its maintainers seem in
truth to have drawn their conclusions altogether from reflection on the
effects produced by Beauty when it is represented in poetry, where
association is undoubtedly the source of the enjoyment; and an attention
to the working of the fine arts would have taught other inferences.</p></div>

<p>p. v. <i>Marigolds.</i> Dr Prior, writing from his place, Halse, near
Taunton, 11 Oct., 1876, says, "I asked in a family here whether they had
ever heard of marigolds being strown on the beds of dying persons, and
they referred me to a book by Lady C. Davies, <i>Recollections of
Society</i>, 1873. At p. 129:</p>

<p>"'Is Little Trianon ominous to crowned women?'</p>

<p>"'Passing through the garden,' said the King, 'I perceived some <i>soucis</i>
(marigolds, emblems of sorrow and care) growing near a tuft of lilies.
This coincidence struck me, and I murmured:</p>

of Shakspeare, the plays of Fletcher appear for several years to have

those of our poet." Malone, <i>Hist. Account of the English Stage</i>,

following, by which he proves his statement.&mdash;F.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><a name="Stack" id="Stack"></a>From the Paper with which Mr J. Herbert Stack opend the discussion at
our Reading of the <i>Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, he has allowd me to make the
following extracts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><ins class="corr" title="original has extraneous quotation mark">To</ins> judge the question clearly, let us note how far the author
or authors of the <i>Two N. K.</i> followed what was the basis of
their drama&mdash;Chaucer's Knightes Tale. We have there the same
opening incident&mdash;the petitions of the Queens, then the
capture of the Two, then their sight of Emily from the prison
window, the release of Arcite, his entry into Emilia's
service, the escape of Palamon, the fight in the wood, the
decree of Theseus, the prayers to Diana, Venus, and Mars, the
combat, the victory in arms to Arcite, his death, and
Palamon's eventual victory in love. But Chaucer is far
superior to the dramatists. He has no Gaoler's Daughter to
distract our thoughts. The language of his Palamon is more
blunt, more soldierlike, more characteristic. His Emilia,
instead of being equally in love with two men at the same
time, prefers maidenhood to marriage, loves neither, but
pities both. At the end of the <i>play</i> we have something
coarse and hurried: Emilia, during the Tournament, is ready
to jump into anybody's arms, so that he comes victorious;
then she accepts Arcite; and on his sudden death, she dries
her tears with more than the supposed celerity of a modern
fashionable widow; and, before she is the widow of Arcite,
consents to become the wife of Palamon. Contrast this with
Chaucer, where the poem dedicates some beautiful lines to the
funeral of Arcite and the grief of all, and only makes Emilia
yield after years to the silent pleading of the woful Palamon
and the urgency of her brother. Contrast the dying speeches
in the two works. In the play, Arcite transfers Emilia almost
as if he were making a will: "<i>Item</i>, I leave my bride to
Palamon." In Chaucer, he says to Emilia that he knows of no
man</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'So worthy to be loved as Palamon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And if that you shal ever be a wyf<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Forget not Palamon that gentil man.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now here we have a play founded on a poem, the original
delicate and noble, where the other is coarse and trivial;
and we ask, 'Was this Shakspere's way of treating his
originals?' In his earlier years he based his <i>Romeo and
Juliet</i> on Brooke's poem of the same name&mdash;a fine work, and
little disfigured by the coarseness of the time. Yet he
pruned it of all really offensive matter, and has given us a
perfect love-story, as ardent as it is pure. His skill in
omission is remarkably shown in one respect. In Brooke's
poem, Juliet, reflecting when alone on Romeo's sudden love,
remembers that he is an enemy to her house, and suspects that
he <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[<a href="./images/114.png">114</a>]</span>may intend dishonourable love as a base means of wreaking
vengeance on hereditary foes. It seems to me that a thought
so cunning is out of character with Juliet&mdash;certainly would
have been felt as a stain on Shakspere's Juliet. That
Shakspere deliberately omitted this, is known by one slight
reference. Juliet says to Romeo,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'If thy intent of love be honourable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Thy purpose marriage.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That is all&mdash;no cunning caution, no base doubt.</p>

<p>Now if in this original, and in this play, we trace the very
manner of Shakspere's working&mdash;taking up gold mixed with
dross, and purifying it in the furnace of his genius&mdash;are we
to suppose that later in life, with taste more fastidious,
even if his imagination were less strong, he carried out a
converse process; that he took Chaucer's gold, and mixed it
with alloy? That, I greatly doubt. Also, would he imitate
himself so closely as he is imitated in certain scenes of the
<i>Two N. K.</i>?</p>

<p>Another point. Love between persons of very different rank
has been held by many dramatists to be a fine subject for the
stage. Shakspere never introduces it. <i>Ophelia</i> loves a
Prince, and <i>Violet</i> a duke, and Rosalind a Squire's son; but
gentlehood unites all. Helena in <i>All's Well</i> is a
gentlewoman. With anything like levelling aspirations
Shakspere had clearly no sympathy. In no undoubted play of
his have we, so far as I remember, any attempt to make the
love of the lowly born for the high a subject of sympathy:
there is no Beggar maid to any of his King Cophetuas. Goneril
and Regan stoop to Edmund through baseness; Malvolio's love
for Olivia is made ridiculous. The Gaoler's Daughter of the
<i>Two N. K.</i> stands alone: like the waiting-maid in the
<i>Critic</i>, she goes mad in white linen, and as painfully
recalls Ophelia, as our cousins the monkeys remind us of men.</p>

<p>In some other respects the poem is far superior to the play.
Chaucer introduces the supernatural powers with excellent
effect and tact&mdash;so as to soften the rigour of the Duke's
decrees. In the Temple, Palamon, the more warlike in manners
of the two, is the more reckless and ardent in his love: of a
simpler nature, Venus entirely subdues and, at the same time,
effectually befriends him. He prays to her not for Victory:
for that he cares not: it matters not how events are brought
about 'so that I have my lady in mine arms.' Arcite, the
softer and more refined knight, prays simply for Victory. If
it be true that love changes the nature of men, here we have
the transformation. The prayer of each is granted, though
they seem opposed&mdash;thus Arcite experiences what many of those
who consulted old oracles found, 'the word of promise kept to
the ear, broken to the hope.' Then in the poem Theseus freely
forgives the two knights, but decides on the Tournament as a
means of seeing who shall have Emilia. In the play he decides
that one is to live and marry, the other to die. The
absurdity of this needless cruelty is evident: it was
possibly introduced to satisfy the coarse tastes of the
audiences who liked the sight of an executioner and a block.</p>

<p>In fact I would say the play is not mainly Shakspere's
because of its un-Shaksperean depth. Who can sympathize with
the cold, coarse balancing of Emilia between the two
men&mdash;eager to have one, ready to take either; betrothed in
haste to one, married in haste to another&mdash;so far flying in
the face of the pure <!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[<a href="./images/115.png">115</a>]</span>beauty of the original, where Emilia
never loses maidenly reserve. Then the final marriage of the
Gaoler's Daughter is as destructive of our sympathy as if
Ophelia had been saved from drowning by the grave-digger, and
married to Horatio at the end of the piece. The pedantry of
Gerrold is poor, the fun of the rustics forced and feeble,
the sternness of Theseus brutal and untouched by final
gentleness as in Chaucer.</p>

<p>Another argument against Shakspere's responsibility for the
whole play is the manner in which the minor characters are
introduced and the underplot managed. A secondary plot is a
characteristic of the Elizabethan drama, borrowed from that
of Spain. But Shakspere is peculiar in the skill with which
he interweaves the two plots and brings together the
principal and the inferior personages. In <i>Hamlet</i> the
soldiers on the watch, the grave-diggers, the players, the
two walking gentlemen, even Osric, all help on the action of
the drama and come into relation with the hero himself. In
<i>King Lear</i>, Edmund and Gloster and Edgar, though engaged in
a subsidiary drama of their own, get mixed up with the
fortunes of the King and his daughters. In <i>Othello</i>, the
foolish Venetian Roderigo and Bianca the courtesan have some
hand in the progress of the play. In <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, the
Nurse and the Friar are agents of the main plot, and the ball
scene pushes on the action. In <i>Shylock</i>, Lancelot Gobbo is
servant to the Jew, and helps Jessica to escape. I need not
multiply instances, as in <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>, Dogberry,
&amp;c. As far as my own recollection serves, I do not believe
that in any play undoubtedly Shakspere's we have a single
instance of an underplot like that of the Gaoler's Daughter.
It might be altogether omitted without affecting the story.
Theseus, Emilia, Hippolyta, Arcite, Palamon, never exchange a
word with the group of Gaoler's Daughter, Wooer, Brother, two
Friends and Doctor; and Palamon's only remembrance of her
services is that at his supposed moment of execution he
generously leaves her the money he had no further need of to
help her to get married to a remarkably tame young man who
assumes the name of his rival in order to bring his
sweetheart to her senses. If this underplot is due to
Shakspere, why is there none like it in all his works? If
these exceedingly thin and very detached minor characters are
his, where in his undoubted plays are others like them&mdash;thus
hanging loosely on to the main machinery of a play? Nor must
we forget that if this underplot is Shakspere's, it is his
when he was an experienced dramatist&mdash;so that after being a
skilful constructor and connecter of plot and underplot in
his youth, 'his right hand forgot its cunning' in his middle
age.</p>

<p>Two other arguments. In the Prologue of the play, written and
recited when it was acted, there are two passages expressing
great fears as to the result,&mdash;one that Chaucer might rise to
condemn the dramatist for spoiling his story,&mdash;another that
the play might be damned, and destroy the fortunes of the
Theatre<a name="FNanchor_115:1_164" id="FNanchor_115:1_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_115:1_164" class="fnanchor">[115:1]</a>. Is this the way in which a play partly
written by Shakspere&mdash;then near the close of his successful
stage career&mdash;would be spoken of on its production?</p>

<p>Another argument is, if Shakspere, using Chaucer's poem as a
model, spoiled it in dramatising it<a name="FNanchor_115:2_165" id="FNanchor_115:2_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_115:2_165" class="fnanchor">[115:2]</a>, then as a poet he
was inferior to Chaucer&mdash;which is absurd.</p>

Following high authorities, anybody may adopt any opinion on
this play and find backers&mdash;the extremes being the German
Tieck, who entirely rejects the idea of Shakspere's
authorship, and Mr Hickson, who throws on him the
responsibility for the whole framework of a play and the
groundwork of every character. I should incline to the middle
opinion<a name="FNanchor_116:1_166" id="FNanchor_116:1_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_116:1_166" class="fnanchor">[116:1]</a>, that Shakspere selected the subject, began
the play, wrote many passages; had no underplot, and
generally left it in a skeleton state; that Fletcher took it
up, patched it here and there, and added an underplot;&mdash;that
Fletcher, not Shakspere, is answerable for all the departures
from Chaucer, for all the underplot, and for the revised play
as it stands. There is nothing improbable in this. After
Shakspere retired to Stratford, Fletcher may have found the
play amongst the MSS. of the Theatre, and then produced it
after due changes made&mdash;not giving the author's name. At that
time it was the custom that a play remained the property of
the company of actors who produced it. That the Blackfriars
Company did <i>not</i> regard the play as Shakspere's is pretty
plain&mdash;for in the edition of 1623, published by Heminge and
Condell of that company, Shakspere's own fellow-players, the
play is not included. Nor does the part authorship account
for the omission, as plays with less of Shakspere's undoubted
authorship are there included. But the omission is
intelligible if the play had been so Fletcherised that it
was, when acted, generally regarded as Fletcher's. Fletcher
was alive in 1623 to claim all as his property; but in 1634
he was dead. Then the publisher, knowing or hearing that
Shakspere had a share, printed <i>his</i> name, after
<i>Fletcher's</i>, as part dramatist. Thus I return to the older
verdict of Coleridge and Lamb, that Shakspere wrote passages
of this play, perhaps also the outlines, but that Fletcher
filled up, added an underplot, and finally revised.</p></div>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
